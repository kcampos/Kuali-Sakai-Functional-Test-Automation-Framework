T*(country!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a)Tj
T*(situation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect)Tj
T*(misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair)Tj
T*(to divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little)Tj
T*(imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes)Tj

T*(as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not)Tj
T*(inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts--')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing.  'I should)Tj
T*(not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it--walk in!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment,)Tj
T*('Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no)Tj
T*(sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance)Tj
T*(determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who)Tj
T*(seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out)Tj
T*(his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway,)Tj
T*(calling, as we entered the court,--'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse;)Tj
T*(and bring up some wine.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the)Tj
T*(reflection suggested by this compound order.  'No wonder the grass grows)Tj
T*(up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale)Tj
T*(and sinewy.  'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of)Tj
T*(peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,)Tj
T*(in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of)Tj
T*(divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no)Tj
T*(reference to my unexpected advent.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  'Wuthering')Tj
T*(being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric)Tj
T*(tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.  Pure, bracing)Tj
T*(ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess)Tj
T*(the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant)Tj
T*(of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt)Tj
T*(thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.)Tj
T*(Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow)Tj
T*(windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large)Tj
T*(jutting stones.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque)Tj
T*(carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door;)Tj
T*(above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless)Tj
T*(little boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.')Tj
T*(I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the)Tj
T*(place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to)Tj
T*(demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to)Tj
T*(aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any)Tj
T*(introductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house')Tj
T*(pre-eminently.  It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe)Tj
T*(at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into)Tj
T*(another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a)Tj
T*(clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of)Tj
T*(roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter)Tj
T*(of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.  One end, indeed,)Tj
T*(reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter)Tj
T*(dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after)Tj
T*(row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.  The latter had never been)Tj

T*(under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except)Tj
T*(where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef,)Tj
T*(mutton, and ham, concealed it.  Above the chimney were sundry villainous)Tj
T*(old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three)Tj
T*(gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.  The floor was of)Tj
T*(smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures,)Tj
T*(painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.  In an)Tj
T*(arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer,)Tj
T*(surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other)Tj
T*(recesses.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as)Tj
T*(belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and)Tj
T*(stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.  Such)Tj
T*(an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the)Tj
T*(round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles)Tj
T*(among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.  But Mr.)Tj
T*(Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.  He)Tj
T*(is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that)Tj
T*(is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly,)Tj
T*(perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an)Tj
T*(erect and handsome figure; and rather morose.  Possibly, some people)Tj
T*(might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic)Tj
T*(chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by)Tj
T*(instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of)Tj
T*(feeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness.  He'll love and hate)Tj
T*(equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved)Tj
T*(or hated again.  No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes)Tj
T*(over-liberally on him.  Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar)Tj
T*(reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be)Tj
T*(acquaintance, to those which actuate me.  Let me hope my constitution is)Tj
T*(almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a)Tj
T*(comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy)Tj
T*(of one.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(While enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown)Tj
T*(into the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my)Tj
T*(eyes, as long as she took no notice of me.  I 'never told my love')Tj
T*(vocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have)Tj
T*(guessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a)Tj
T*(return--the sweetest of all imaginable looks.  And what did I do?  I)Tj
T*(confess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every)Tj
T*(glance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led)Tj
T*(to doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed)Tj
T*(mistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of)Tj
T*(disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how)Tj
T*(undeserved, I alone can appreciate.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which)Tj
T*(my landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting)Tj
T*(to caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking)Tj
T*(wolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth)Tj
T*(watering for a snatch.  My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You'd better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,)Tj
T*(checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.  'She's not)Tj
T*(accustomed to be spoiled--not kept for a pet.'  Then, striding to a side)Tj
T*(door, he shouted again, 'Joseph!')Tj

T*(intimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me _vis-)Tj
T*(a-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs, who)Tj
T*(shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements.  Not)Tj
T*(anxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining)Tj
T*(they would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged in)Tj
T*(winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy so)Tj
T*(irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my)Tj
T*(knees.  I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.)Tj
T*(This proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends,)Tj
T*(of various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.)Tj
T*(I felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying)Tj
T*(off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I was)Tj
T*(constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household in re-)Tj
T*(establishing peace.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious)Tj
T*(phlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though the)Tj
T*(hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping.  Happily, an)Tj
T*(inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with tucked-)Tj
T*(up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the midst of us)Tj
T*(flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her tongue, to such)Tj
T*(purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only remained,)Tj
T*(heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered on the)Tj
T*(scene.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What the devil is the matter?' he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I)Tj
T*(could ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What the devil, indeed!' I muttered.  'The herd of possessed swine could)Tj
T*(have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.  You)Tj
T*(might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting)Tj
T*(the bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.  'The dogs do)Tj
T*(right to be vigilant.  Take a glass of wine?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, thank you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not bitten, are you?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.'  Heathcliff's)Tj
T*(countenance relaxed into a grin.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Come, come,' he said, 'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.  Here, take a)Tj
T*(little wine.  Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my)Tj
T*(dogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.  Your health,)Tj
T*(sir?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be)Tj
T*(foolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I)Tj
T*(felt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his)Tj
T*(humour took that turn.  He--probably swayed by prudential consideration)Tj
T*(of the folly of offending a good tenant--relaxed a little in the laconic)Tj
T*(style of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced)Tj
T*(what he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,--a discourse on)Tj
T*(the advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.  I)Tj
T*(found him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went)Tj
T*(home, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.  He)Tj
T*(evidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.  I shall go,)Tj
T*(notwithstanding.  It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared)Tj

T*(CHAPTER II)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.  I had half a mind to spend it)Tj
T*(by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering)Tj
T*(Heights.  On coming up from dinner, however, \(N.B.--I dine between twelve)Tj
T*(and one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture)Tj
T*(along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that)Tj
T*(I might be served at five\)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy)Tj
T*(intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees)Tj
T*(surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as)Tj
T*(she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.  This spectacle drove)Tj
T*(me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk,)Tj
T*(arrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first)Tj
T*(feathery flakes of a snow-shower.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air)Tj
T*(made me shiver through every limb.  Being unable to remove the chain, I)Tj
T*(jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with)Tj
T*(straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my)Tj
T*(knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated, mentally, 'you deserve perpetual)Tj
T*(isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality.  At least, I)Tj
T*(would not keep my doors barred in the day-time.  I don't care--I will get)Tj
T*(in!'  So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.  Vinegar-)Tj
T*(faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What are ye for?' he shouted.  'T' maister's down i' t' fowld.  Go round)Tj
T*(by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer)Tj
T*(flaysome dins till neeght.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why?  Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nor-ne me!  I'll hae no hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The snow began to drive thickly.  I seized the handle to essay another)Tj
T*(trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,)Tj
T*(appeared in the yard behind.  He hailed me to follow him, and, after)Tj
T*(marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,)Tj
T*(pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful)Tj
T*(apartment where I was formerly received.  It glowed delightfully in the)Tj
T*(radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near)Tj
T*(the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe)Tj
T*(the 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously)Tj
T*(suspected.  I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat.)Tj
T*(She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and)Tj
T*(mute.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(She never opened her mouth.  I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she)Tj
T*(kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly)Tj
T*(embarrassing and disagreeable.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Sit down,' said the young man, gruffly.  'He'll be in soon.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this)Tj
T*(second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning)Tj
T*(my acquaintance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A beautiful animal!' I commenced again.  'Do you intend parting with the)Tj
T*(little ones, madam?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than)Tj
T*(Heathcliff himself could have replied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure)Tj
T*(cushion full of something like cats.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.  I hemmed once more, and drew)Tj
T*(closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the)Tj
T*(evening.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the)Tj
T*(chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct)Tj
T*(view of her whole figure and countenance.  She was slender, and)Tj
T*(apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most)Tj
T*(exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;)Tj
T*(small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging)Tj
T*(loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in)Tj
T*(expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my)Tj
T*(susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn)Tj
T*(and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.  The)Tj
T*(canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she)Tj
T*(turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him)Tj
T*(in counting his gold.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I don't want your help,' she snapped; 'I can get them for myself.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black)Tj
T*(frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.)Tj
T*()Tj

T*(Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby)Tj
T*(upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me)Tj
T*(from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some)Tj
T*(mortal feud unavenged between us.  I began to doubt whether he were a)Tj
T*(servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of)Tj
T*(the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown)Tj
T*(curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over)Tj
T*(his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:)Tj
T*(still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a)Tj
T*(domestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.  In the)Tj
T*(absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain)Tj
T*(from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the)Tj
T*(entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my)Tj
T*(uncomfortable state.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!' I exclaimed, assuming)Tj
T*(the cheerful; 'and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if)Tj
T*(you can afford me shelter during that space.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Half an hour?' he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; 'I)Tj
T*(wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.  Do)Tj
T*(you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?  People)Tj
T*(familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I)Tj
T*(can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the)Tj
T*(Grange till morning--could you spare me one?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, I could not.')Tj

T*('Oh, indeed!  Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Umph!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Are you going to mak' the tea?' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting)Tj
T*(his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Is _he_ to have any?' she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, uttered so savagely that I)Tj
T*(started.  The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad)Tj
T*(nature.  I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.)Tj
T*(When the preparations were finished, he invited me with--'Now, sir, bring)Tj
T*(forward your chair.'  And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round)Tj
T*(the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to)Tj
T*(dispel it.  They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was)Tj
T*(impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl)Tj
T*(they wore was their every-day countenance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is strange,' I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea)Tj
T*(and receiving another--'it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and)Tj
T*(ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of)Tj
T*(such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,)Tj
T*(I'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your)Tj
T*(amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart--')Tj

T*('Well, yes--oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of)Tj
T*(ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even)Tj
T*(when her body is gone.  Is that it?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.  I might have)Tj
T*(seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to)Tj
T*(make it likely that they were man and wife.  One was about forty: a)Tj
T*(period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being)Tj
T*(married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our)Tj
T*(declining years.  The other did not look seventeen.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Then it flashed on me--'The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea)Tj
T*(out of a basin and eating his broad with unwashed hands, may be her)Tj
T*(husband: Heathcliff junior, of course.  Here is the consequence of being)Tj
T*(buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer)Tj
T*(ignorance that better individuals existed!  A sad pity--I must beware how)Tj
T*(I cause her to regret her choice.'  The last reflection may seem)Tj
T*(conceited; it was not.  My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;)Tj
T*(I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' said Heathcliff, corroborating)Tj
T*(my surmise.  He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a)Tj
T*(look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that)Tj
T*(will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah, certainly--I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the)Tj
T*(beneficent fairy,' I remarked, turning to my neighbour.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his)Tj
T*(fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.  But he seemed to)Tj
T*(recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,)Tj
T*(muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' observed my host; 'we neither of us)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('And this young man is--')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not my son, assuredly.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to)Tj
T*(attribute the paternity of that bear to him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the other; 'and I'd counsel you to)Tj
T*(respect it!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I've shown no disrespect,' was my reply, laughing internally at the)Tj
T*(dignity with which he announced himself.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear)Tj
T*(I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.)Tj
T*(I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.)Tj
T*(The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the)Tj

T*(The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of)Tj
T*(sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.  A)Tj
T*(sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and)Tj
T*(hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph)Tj

T*(over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which)Tj
T*(had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its)Tj
T*(place.  The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical)Tj
T*(survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out--'Aw wonder how yah)Tj

T*(I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to)Tj

T*(intention of kicking him out of the door.  Mrs. Heathcliff, however,)Tj
T*(checked me by her answer.)Tj

T*('You scandalous old hypocrite!' she replied.  'Are you not afraid of)Tj

T*(you to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special)Tj
T*(favour!  Stop! look here, Joseph,' she continued, taking a long, dark)Tj
T*(book from a shelf; 'I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black)Tj

T*(and a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach)Tj
T*(windows.  Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and)Tj
T*(perceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very)Tj
T*(conveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the)Tj
T*(family having a room to himself.  In fact, it formed a little closet, and)Tj
T*(the ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.  I slid back)Tj
T*(the panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and)Tj
T*(felt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in)Tj
T*(one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.  This)Tj
T*(writing, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of)Tj
T*(characters, large and small--_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied)Tj
T*(to _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued)Tj
T*(spelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes)Tj
T*(closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white)Tj
T*(letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with)Tj
T*(Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered)Tj
T*(my candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the)Tj
T*(place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  I snuffed it off, and, very)Tj
T*(ill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and)Tj
T*(spread open the injured tome on my knee.  It was a Testament, in lean)Tj
T*(type, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the)Tj
T*(inscription--'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some quarter of a)Tj
T*(century back.  I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had)Tj
T*(examined all.  Catherine's library was select, and its state of)Tj
T*(dilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for)Tj
T*(a legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink)Tj
T*(commentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of)Tj
T*(blank that the printer had left.  Some were detached sentences; other)Tj
T*(parts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish)Tj
T*(hand.  At the top of an extra page \(quite a treasure, probably, when)Tj
T*(first lighted on\) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature)Tj

T*(for the effects of bad tea and bad temper!  What else could it be that)Tj
T*(made me pass such a terrible night?  I don't remember another that I can)Tj
T*(at all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.  I)Tj
T*(thought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for)Tj
T*(a guide.  The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,)Tj
T*(my companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a)Tj
T*(pilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without)Tj
T*(one, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood)Tj
T*(to be so denominated.  For a moment I considered it absurd that I should)Tj
T*(need such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.  Then a new)Tj
T*(idea flashed across me.  I was not going there: we were journeying to)Tj
T*(hear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text--'Seventy Times)Tj
T*(Seven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the 'First of)Tj
T*(the Seventy-First,' and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We came to the chapel.  I have passed it really in my walks, twice or)Tj
T*(thrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near)Tj
T*(a swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of)Tj
T*(embalming on the few corpses deposited there.  The roof has been kept)Tj
T*(whole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per)Tj
T*(annum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into)Tj
T*(one, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it)Tj
T*(is currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than)Tj
T*(increase the living by one penny from their own pockets.  However, in my)Tj
T*(dream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached--good)Tj
T*(God! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each)Tj
T*(fully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a)Tj
T*(separate sin!  Where he searched for them, I cannot tell.  He had his)Tj
T*(private manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the)Tj
T*(brother should sin different sins on every occasion.  They were of the)Tj
T*(most curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined)Tj
T*(previously.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Oh, how weary I grow.  How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and)Tj
T*(revived!  How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood)Tj
T*(up, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_)Tj
T*(have done.  I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the)Tj
T*('_First of the Seventy-First_.'  At that crisis, a sudden inspiration)Tj
T*(descended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the)Tj
T*(sinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Sir,' I exclaimed, 'sitting here within these four walls, at one)Tj
T*(stretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of)Tj
T*(your discourse.  Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and)Tj
T*(been about to depart--Seventy times seven times have you preposterously)Tj

T*(staves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in)Tj
T*(self-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most)Tj
T*(ferocious assailant, for his.  In the confluence of the multitude,)Tj
T*(several clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.)Tj
T*(Presently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings:)Tj
T*(every man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to)Tj
T*(remain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards)Tj
T*(of the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my)Tj
T*(unspeakable relief, they woke me.  And what was it that had suggested the)Tj
T*(tremendous tumult?  What had played Jabez's part in the row?  Merely the)Tj
T*(branch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and)Tj
T*(rattled its dry cones against the panes!  I listened doubtingly an)Tj
T*(instant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again:)Tj
T*(if possible, still more disagreeably than before.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard)Tj
T*(distinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,)Tj
T*(the fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right)Tj
T*(cause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if)Tj
T*(possible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.)Tj
T*(The hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when)Tj
T*(awake, but forgotten.  'I must stop it, nevertheless!' I muttered,)Tj
T*(knocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to)Tj
T*(seize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the)Tj
T*(fingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  The intense horror of nightmare came)Tj
T*(over me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a)Tj
T*(most melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in--let me in!'  'Who are you?' I)Tj
T*(asked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  'Catherine Linton,')Tj
T*(it replied, shiveringly \(why did I think of _Linton_?  I had read)Tj
T*(_Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton\)--'I'm come home: I'd lost my way on)Tj
T*(the moor!'  As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking)Tj
T*(through the window.  Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to)Tj
T*(attempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken)Tj
T*(pane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the)Tj
T*(bedclothes: still it wailed, 'Let me in!' and maintained its tenacious)Tj
T*(gripe, almost maddening me with fear.  'How can I!' I said at length.)Tj
T*('Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!'  The fingers relaxed, I)Tj
T*(snatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid)Tj
T*(against it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  I)Tj
T*(seemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I)Tj
T*(listened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!  'Begone!' I)Tj
T*(shouted.  'I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.'  'It)Tj
T*(is twenty years,' mourned the voice: 'twenty years.  I've been a waif for)Tj
T*(twenty years!'  Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile)Tj
T*(of books moved as if thrust forward.  I tried to jump up; but could not)Tj
T*(stir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.  To my)Tj
T*(confusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps)Tj
T*(approached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous)Tj
T*(hand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.  I)Tj
T*(sat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the)Tj
T*(intruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.  At last, he)Tj
T*(said, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, 'Is any one)Tj
T*(here?'  I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew)Tj
T*(Heathcliff's accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept)Tj
T*(quiet.  With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.  I shall not)Tj

T*(much inferior.  'Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?')Tj
T*(I inquired.)Tj
T*()Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Before I came to live here, she commenced--waiting no farther invitation)Tj
T*(to her story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother)Tj

T*(hay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me)Tj
T*(to.  One fine summer morning--it was the beginning of harvest, I)Tj
T*(remember--Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a)Tj
T*(journey; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the)Tj
T*(day, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me--for I sat eating my)Tj
T*(porridge with them--and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man,)Tj
T*(I'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?  You may choose)Tj
T*(what you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back:)Tj
T*(sixty miles each way, that is a long spell!'  Hindley named a fiddle, and)Tj
T*(then he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could)Tj
T*(ride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.  He did not forget)Tj
T*(me; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes.  He)Tj
T*(promised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed)Tj
T*(his children, said good-bye, and set off.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his absence--and)Tj

T*(after hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the)Tj
T*(children got tired of running down to the gate to look.  Then it grew)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,)Tj
T*(ragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its)Tj
T*(face looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it)Tj
T*(only stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that)Tj
T*(nobody could understand.  I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready)Tj
T*(to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to)Tj
T*(bring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to)Tj
T*(feed and fend for?  What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?)Tj
T*(The master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with)Tj
T*(fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale)Tj
T*(of his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the)Tj
T*(streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.)Tj
T*(Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time)Tj
T*(being both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at)Tj
T*(once, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he)Tj
T*(would not leave it as he found it.  Well, the conclusion was, that my)Tj
T*(mistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and)Tj
T*(give it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Hindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till)Tj
T*(peace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets for)Tj
T*(the presents he had promised them.  The former was a boy of fourteen, but)Tj
T*(when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the great-)Tj
T*(coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master had lost)Tj
T*(her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by grinning and)Tj
T*(spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains a sound blow)Tj
T*(from her father, to teach her cleaner manners.  They entirely refused to)Tj
T*(have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and I had no more sense,)Tj
T*(so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it might he gone on the)Tj
T*(morrow.  By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to)Tj
T*(Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber.)Tj
T*(Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and)Tj
T*(in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family.  On coming back a)Tj
T*(few days afterwards \(for I did not consider my banishment perpetual\), I)Tj
T*(found they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who)Tj
T*(died in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian)Tj
T*(and surname.  Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated)Tj
T*(him: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with)Tj
T*(him shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and)Tj
T*(the mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:)Tj
T*(he would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my)Tj
T*(pinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he)Tj
T*(had hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.  This endurance)Tj
T*(made old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the)Tj
T*(poor fatherless child, as he called him.  He took to Heathcliff)Tj
T*(strangely, believing all he said \(for that matter, he said precious)Tj
T*(little, and generally the truth\), and petting him up far above Cathy, who)Tj
T*(was too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at)Tj
T*(Mrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the)Tj
T*(young master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than)Tj
T*(a friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his)Tj
T*(privileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.  I)Tj

T*(sympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I)Tj
T*(had to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed)Tj
T*(my idea.  Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst)Tj
T*(he would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good)Tj
T*(deal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.)Tj
T*(However, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse)Tj
T*(watched over.  The difference between him and the others forced me to be)Tj
T*(less partial.  Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as)Tj
T*(uncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give)Tj
T*(little trouble.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing)Tj
T*(to me, and praised me for my care.  I was vain of his commendations, and)Tj
T*(softened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley)Tj
T*(lost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered)Tj
T*(often what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never,)Tj
T*(to my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.  He)Tj
T*(was not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though)Tj
T*(knowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only)Tj
T*(to speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.  As an)Tj
T*(instance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the)Tj
T*(parish fair, and gave the lads each one.  Heathcliff took the handsomest,)Tj
T*(but it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley--)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I)Tj
T*(shall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week,)Tj
T*(and show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.'  Hindley put out)Tj
T*(his tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.  'You'd better do it at once,')Tj
T*(he persisted, escaping to the porch \(they were in the stable\): 'you will)Tj
T*(have to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with)Tj
T*(interest.'  'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron)Tj
T*(weight used for weighing potatoes and hay.  'Throw it,' he replied,)Tj
T*(standing still, 'and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn)Tj
T*(me out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you)Tj
T*(out directly.'  Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he)Tj
T*(fell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I)Tj
T*(prevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full)Tj
T*(revenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused)Tj
T*(it.  'Take my colt, Gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw.  'And I pray that)Tj
T*(he may break your neck: take him, and he damned, you beggarly interloper!)Tj
T*(and wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what)Tj
T*(you are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he'll kick out your)Tj
T*(brains!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he)Tj
T*(was passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him)Tj
T*(under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were)Tj
T*(fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.  I was surprised to witness how)Tj
T*(coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention;)Tj
T*(exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to)Tj
T*(overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered)Tj
T*(the house.  I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises)Tj
T*(on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he)Tj
T*(wanted.  He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I)Tj
T*(really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will)Tj

T*(CHAPTER V)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail.  He had been active and)Tj
T*(healthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to)Tj
T*(the chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable.  A nothing vexed him;)Tj
T*(and suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits.  This)Tj
T*(was especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or)Tj
T*(domineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word should)Tj
T*(be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the notion)Tj
T*(that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do him an ill-)Tj
T*(turn.  It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among us did not)Tj
T*(wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and that)Tj
T*(humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black tempers.)Tj
T*(Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice, Hindley's)Tj
T*(manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the old man to)Tj
T*(a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with rage that he)Tj
T*(could not do it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At last, our curate \(we had a curate then who made the living answer by)Tj
T*(teaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land)Tj
T*(himself\) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.)Tj
T*(Earnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said--'Hindley was)Tj
T*(nought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I hoped heartily we should have peace now.  It hurt me to think the)Tj
T*(master should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.  I fancied the)Tj
T*(discontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he)Tj
T*(would have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking)Tj
T*(frame.  We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two)Tj
T*(people--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up)Tj
T*(yonder.  He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous)Tj
T*(Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and)Tj
T*(fling the curses to his neighbours.  By his knack of sermonising and)Tj
T*(pious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr.)Tj
T*(Earnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he)Tj
T*(gained.  He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and)Tj
T*(about ruling his children rigidly.  He encouraged him to regard Hindley)Tj
T*(as a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long)Tj
T*(string of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to)Tj
T*(flatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up)Tj
T*(before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener)Tj
T*(in a day: from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to)Tj
T*(bed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief.  Her)Tj
T*(spirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going--singing,)Tj
T*(laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.  A wild,)Tj
T*(wicked slip she was--but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile,)Tj
T*(and lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no)Tj
T*(harm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened)Tj
T*(that she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you)Tj
T*(might comfort her.  She was much too fond of Heathcliff.  The greatest)Tj
T*(punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet)Tj
T*(she got chided more than any of us on his account.  In play, she liked)Tj
T*(exceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and)Tj
T*(commanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear)Tj
T*(slapping and ordering; and so I let her know.)Tj

T*(always been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had)Tj
T*(no idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing)Tj
T*(condition than he was in his prime.  His peevish reproofs wakened in her)Tj
T*(a naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were)Tj
T*(all scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look,)Tj
T*(and her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule,)Tj
T*(baiting me, and doing just what her father hated most--showing how her)Tj
T*(pretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over)Tj
T*(Heathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in)Tj
T*(anything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.  After)Tj
T*(behaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to)Tj
T*(make it up at night.  'Nay, Cathy,' the old man would say, 'I cannot love)Tj
T*(thee, thou'rt worse than thy brother.  Go, say thy prayers, child, and)Tj
T*(ask God's pardon.  I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared)Tj
T*(thee!'  That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually)Tj
T*(hardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her)Tj
T*(faults, and beg to be forgiven.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth.)Tj
T*(He died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the)Tj
T*(fire-side.  A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the)Tj
T*(chimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all)Tj
T*(together--I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and)Tj
T*(Joseph reading his Bible near the table \(for the servants generally sat)Tj
T*(in the house then, after their work was done\).  Miss Cathy had been sick,)Tj
T*(and that made her still; she leant against her father's knee, and)Tj
T*(Heathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.  I remember)Tj
T*(the master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair--it)Tj
T*(pleased him rarely to see her gentle--and saying, 'Why canst thou not)Tj
T*(always be a good lass, Cathy?'  And she turned her face up to his, and)Tj
T*(laughed, and answered, 'Why cannot you always be a good man, father?'  But)Tj
T*(as soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she)Tj
T*(would sing him to sleep.  She began singing very low, till his fingers)Tj
T*(dropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.  Then I told her to)Tj
T*(hush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.  We all kept as mute as)Tj
T*(mice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph,)Tj
T*(having finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the)Tj
T*(master for prayers and bed.  He stepped forward, and called him by name,)Tj
T*(and touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle)Tj
T*(and looked at him.  I thought there was something wrong as he set down)Tj
T*(the light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to)Tj
T*('frame up-stairs, and make little din--they might pray alone that)Tj
T*(evening--he had summut to do.')Tj

T*('I shall bid father good-night first,' said Catherine, putting her arms)Tj
T*(round his neck, before we could hinder her.  The poor thing discovered)Tj
T*(her loss directly--she screamed out--'Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's)Tj
T*(dead!'  And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.)Tj

T*(I joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we)Tj

T*(I could not guess the use that either would be of, then.  However, I)Tj

T*(the other said he would come in the morning.  Leaving Joseph to explain)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, and)Tj
T*(set the neighbours gossiping right and left--he brought a wife with him.)Tj
T*(What she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she)Tj
T*(had neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have)Tj
T*(kept the union from his father.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own)Tj
T*(account.  Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,)Tj
T*(appeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about)Tj
T*(her: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the)Tj
T*(mourners.  I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that)Tj
T*(went on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I)Tj
T*(should have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and)Tj
T*(clasping her hands, and asking repeatedly--'Are they gone yet?'  Then she)Tj
T*(began describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to)Tj
T*(see black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping--and)Tj
T*(when I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn't know; but she felt)Tj
T*(so afraid of dying!  I imagined her as little likely to die as myself.)Tj
T*(She was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes)Tj
T*(sparkled as bright as diamonds.  I did remark, to be sure, that mounting)Tj
T*(the stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set)Tj
T*(her all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I)Tj
T*(knew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to)Tj
T*(sympathise with her.  We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr.)Tj
T*(Lockwood, unless they take to us first.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Young Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his)Tj
T*(absence.  He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed)Tj
T*(quite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph and)Tj
T*(me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and leave)Tj
T*(the house for him.  Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a small)Tj
T*(spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at the)Tj
T*(white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and delf-)Tj
T*(case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in where)Tj
T*(they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort, and so)Tj
T*(dropped the intention.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new)Tj
T*(acquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran)Tj
T*(about with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.)Tj
T*(Her affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,)Tj
T*(Hindley became tyrannical.  A few words from her, evincing a dislike to)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.  He)Tj
T*(drove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the)Tj
T*(instructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of)Tj
T*(doors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the)Tj
T*(farm.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy)Tj
T*(taught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields.)Tj
T*(They both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master)Tj

T*(being entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they)Tj
T*(kept clear of him.  He would not even have seen after their going to)Tj
T*(church on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his)Tj
T*(carelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to)Tj
T*(order Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.)Tj
T*(But it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the)Tj
T*(morning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere)Tj
T*(thing to laugh at.  The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased)Tj
T*(for Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till)Tj
T*(his arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together)Tj
T*(again: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of)Tj
T*(revenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more)Tj
T*(reckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing)Tj
T*(the small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures.  One)Tj
T*(Sunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room,)Tj
T*(for making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to)Tj
T*(call them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.  We searched the)Tj
T*(house, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible:)Tj
T*(and, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore)Tj
T*(nobody should let them in that night.  The household went to bed; and I,)Tj
T*(too, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to)Tj
T*(hearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the)Tj
T*(prohibition, should they return.  In a while, I distinguished steps)Tj
T*(coming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the)Tj
T*(gate.  I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking)Tj
T*(Mr. Earnshaw by knocking.  There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a)Tj
T*(start to see him alone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly.  'No accident, I hope?'  'At)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange,' he answered; 'and I would have been there too, but)Tj
T*(they had not the manners to ask me to stay.'  'Well, you will catch it!')Tj
T*(I said: 'you'll never be content till you're sent about your business.)Tj
T*(What in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?'  'Let me get)Tj
T*(off my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,' he replied.  I)Tj
T*(bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I waited)Tj
T*(to put out the candle, he continued--'Cathy and I escaped from the wash-)Tj
T*(house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the Grange)Tj
T*(lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons passed)Tj
T*(their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their father)Tj
T*(and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and burning)Tj
T*(their eyes out before the fire.  Do you think they do?  Or reading)Tj
T*(sermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a)Tj
T*(column of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?'  'Probably)Tj
T*(not,' I responded.  'They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve)Tj
T*(the treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.'  'Don't cant, Nelly,')Tj
T*(he said: 'nonsense!  We ran from the top of the Heights to the park,)Tj
T*(without stopping--Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she)Tj
T*(was barefoot.  You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow.  We)Tj
T*(crept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted)Tj
T*(ourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window.  The light came)Tj
T*(from thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were only)Tj
T*(half closed.  Both of us were able to look in by standing on the)Tj
T*(basement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a)Tj
T*(splendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and)Tj
T*(tables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of)Tj
T*(glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering with)Tj
T*(little soft tapers.  Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar and)Tj
T*(his sisters had it entirely to themselves.  Shouldn't they have been)Tj
T*(happy?  We should have thought ourselves in heaven!  And now, guess what)Tj
T*(your good children were doing?  Isabella--I believe she is eleven, a year)Tj

T*(younger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,)Tj
T*(shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her.  Edgar)Tj
T*(stood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat)Tj
T*(a little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual)Tj
T*(accusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.)Tj
T*(The idiots!  That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap)Tj
T*(of warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to get)Tj
T*(it, refused to take it.  We laughed outright at the petted things; we did)Tj
T*(despise them!  When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine)Tj
T*(wanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and)Tj
T*(sobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room?  I'd not)Tj
T*(exchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange--not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph)Tj
T*(off the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's)Tj
T*(blood!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Hush, hush!' I interrupted.  'Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,)Tj
T*(how Catherine is left behind?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I told you we laughed,' he answered.  'The Lintons heard us, and with)Tj
T*(one accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and then)Tj
T*(a cry, "Oh, mamma, mamma!  Oh, papa!  Oh, mamma, come here.  Oh, papa,)Tj
T*(oh!"  They really did howl out something in that way.  We made frightful)Tj
T*(noises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge,)Tj
T*(because somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee.  I)Tj
T*(had Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell)Tj
T*(down.  "Run, Heathcliff, run!" she whispered.  "They have let the bull-)Tj
T*(dog loose, and he holds me!"  The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I)Tj
T*(heard his abominable snorting.  She did not yell out--no! she would have)Tj
T*(scorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow.  I)Tj
T*(did, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in)Tj
T*(Christendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried)Tj
T*(with all my might to cram it down his throat.  A beast of a servant came)Tj
T*(up with a lantern, at last, shouting--"Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!"  He)Tj
T*(changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game.  The dog was)Tj
T*(throttled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his)Tj
T*(mouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver.  The man took)Tj
T*(Cathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain.  He)Tj
T*(carried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance.  "What)Tj
T*(prey, Robert?" hallooed Linton from the entrance.  "Skulker has caught a)Tj
T*(little girl, sir," he replied; "and there's a lad here," he added, making)Tj
T*(a clutch at me, "who looks an out-and-outer!  Very like the robbers were)Tj
T*(for putting them through the window to open the doors to the gang after)Tj
T*(all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.  Hold your)Tj
T*(tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the gallows for)Tj
T*(this.  Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun."  "No, no, Robert," said)Tj
T*(the old fool.  "The rascals knew that yesterday was my rent-day: they)Tj
T*(thought to have me cleverly.  Come in; I'll furnish them a reception.)Tj
T*(There, John, fasten the chain.  Give Skulker some water, Jenny.  To beard)Tj
T*(a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!  Where will)Tj
T*(their insolence stop?  Oh, my dear Mary, look here!  Don't be afraid, it)Tj
T*(is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face; would it not)Tj
T*(be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he shows his)Tj
T*(nature in acts as well as features?"  He pulled me under the chandelier,)Tj
T*(and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised her hands in)Tj
T*(horror.  The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella)Tj
T*(lisping--"Frightful thing!  Put him in the cellar, papa.  He's exactly)Tj
T*(like the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant.  Isn't)Tj
T*(he, Edgar?")Tj

T*('While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and)Tj
T*(laughed.  Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient)Tj
T*(wit to recognise her.  They see us at church, you know, though we seldom)Tj
T*(meet them elsewhere.  "That's Miss Earnshaw?" he whispered to his mother,)Tj
T*("and look how Skulker has bitten her--how her foot bleeds!")Tj
T*()Tj
T*('"Miss Earnshaw?  Nonsense!" cried the dame; "Miss Earnshaw scouring the)Tj
T*(country with a gipsy!  And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning--surely)Tj
T*(it is--and she may be lamed for life!")Tj
T*()Tj
T*('"What culpable carelessness in her brother!" exclaimed Mr. Linton,)Tj
T*(turning from me to Catherine.  "I've understood from Shielders"' \(that)Tj
T*(was the curate, sir\) '"that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.)Tj
T*(But who is this?  Where did she pick up this companion?  Oho! I declare)Tj
T*(he is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to)Tj
T*(Liverpool--a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*('"A wicked boy, at all events," remarked the old lady, "and quite unfit)Tj
T*(for a decent house!  Did you notice his language, Linton?  I'm shocked)Tj
T*(that my children should have heard it.")Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert was ordered)Tj
T*(to take me off.  I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the)Tj
T*(garden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw)Tj
T*(should be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,)Tj
T*(secured the door again.  The curtains were still looped up at one corner,)Tj
T*(and I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to)Tj
T*(return, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of)Tj
T*(fragments, unless they let her out.  She sat on the sofa quietly.  Mrs.)Tj
T*(Linton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed)Tj
T*(for our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I)Tj
T*(suppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her)Tj
T*(treatment and mine.  Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm)Tj
T*(water, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and)Tj
T*(Isabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping)Tj
T*(at a distance.  Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and)Tj
T*(gave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I)Tj
T*(left her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little)Tj
T*(dog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark)Tj
T*(of spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from)Tj
T*(her own enchanting face.  I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she)Tj
T*(is so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she not,)Tj
T*(Nelly?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered,)Tj
T*(covering him up and extinguishing the light.  'You are incurable,)Tj
T*(Heathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if)Tj
T*(he won't.'  My words came truer than I desired.  The luckless adventure)Tj
T*(made Earnshaw furious.  And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a)Tj
T*(visit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on)Tj
T*(the road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in)Tj
T*(earnest.  Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first)Tj
T*(word he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs.)Tj
T*(Earnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she)Tj
T*(returned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found)Tj
T*(it impossible.)Tj

T*(CHAPTER VII)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.  By that)Tj
T*(time her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.  The)Tj
T*(mistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of)Tj
T*(reform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and)Tj
T*(flattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless)Tj
T*(little savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all)Tj
T*(breathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified)Tj
T*(person, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,)Tj
T*(and a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands)Tj
T*(that she might sail in.  Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming)Tj
T*(delightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!  I should scarcely have)Tj
T*(known you: you look like a lady now.  Isabella Linton is not to be)Tj
T*(compared with her, is she, Frances?'  'Isabella has not her natural)Tj
T*(advantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again)Tj
T*(here.  Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things--Stay, dear, you)Tj
T*(will disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk)Tj
T*(frock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled)Tj
T*(joyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly)Tj
T*(touch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.  She kissed)Tj
T*(me gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not)Tj
T*(have done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.  Mr.)Tj
T*(and Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would)Tj
T*(enable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping)Tj
T*(to succeed in separating the two friends.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff was hard to discover, at first.  If he were careless, and)Tj
T*(uncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so)Tj
T*(since.  Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,)Tj
T*(and bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom)Tj
T*(have a natural pleasure in soap and water.  Therefore, not to mention his)Tj
T*(clothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his)Tj
T*(thick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally)Tj
T*(beclouded.  He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a)Tj
T*(bright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed)Tj
T*(counterpart of himself, as he expected.  'Is Heathcliff not here?' she)Tj
T*(demanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully)Tj
T*(whitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his)Tj
T*(discomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he)Tj
T*(would be compelled to present himself.  'You may come and wish Miss)Tj
T*(Catherine welcome, like the other servants.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to)Tj
T*(embrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the)Tj
T*(second, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,)Tj
T*(exclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny)Tj
T*(and grim!  But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.)Tj
T*(Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double)Tj
T*(gloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a)Tj
T*(way, that is permitted.')Tj

T*('I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not)Tj

T*(from the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself:)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, shake hands at least!  What are you sulky for?  It was only)Tj
T*(that you looked odd.  If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will)Tj

T*('You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and)Tj
T*(snatching away his hand.  'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to)Tj
T*(be dirty, and I will be dirty.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(With that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of)Tj
T*(the master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who)Tj
T*(could not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an)Tj
T*(exhibition of bad temper.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(After playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the)Tj
T*(oven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,)Tj
T*(befitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by)Tj
T*(singing carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he)Tj
T*(considered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.  He had retired)Tj
T*(to private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging)Tj
T*(Missy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the)Tj
T*(little Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.  They had invited)Tj
T*(them to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had)Tj
T*(been accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings)Tj
T*(might be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Under these circumstances I remained solitary.  I smelt the rich scent of)Tj
T*(the heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the)Tj
T*(polished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready)Tj
T*(to be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless)Tj
T*(purity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor.  I gave)Tj
T*(due inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old)Tj
T*(Earnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,)Tj
T*(and slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went)Tj
T*(on to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should)Tj
T*(suffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to)Tj
T*(consider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind)Tj
T*(to crying.  It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in)Tj
T*(endeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them:)Tj
T*(I got up and walked into the court to seek him.  He was not far; I found)Tj
T*(him smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding)Tj
T*(the other beasts, according to custom.)Tj

T*('Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.  Catherine supped)Tj
T*(with her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable)Tj
T*(meal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.  His)Tj
T*(cake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.  He)Tj
T*(managed to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and)Tj
T*(dour to his chamber.  Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to)Tj
T*(order for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen)Tj

T*(what was the matter with him, and then went back.  In the morning he rose)Tj

T*(not re-appearing till the family were departed for church.  Fasting and)Tj
T*(reflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.  He hung about)Tj
T*(me for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed)Tj
T*(abruptly--'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you _have_ grieved Catherine: she's)Tj
T*(sorry she ever came home, I daresay!  It looks as if you envied her,)Tj
T*(because she is more thought of than you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the)Tj
T*(notion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, _I_ cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry)Tj
T*(than she.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty)Tj
T*(stomach,' said I.  'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.  But,)Tj
T*(if you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she)Tj
T*(comes in.  You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say--you know best)Tj
T*(what to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted)Tj
T*(into a stranger by her grand dress.  And now, though I have dinner to get)Tj
T*(ready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look)Tj
T*(quite a doll beside you: and that he does.  You are younger, and yet,)Tj
T*(I'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;)Tj
T*(you could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and)Tj
T*(he sighed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him)Tj
T*(less handsome or me more so.  I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,)Tj
T*(and was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as)Tj
T*(he will be!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country)Tj
T*(lad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of)Tj
T*(rain.  Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!  Come to the glass,)Tj
T*(and I'll let you see what you should wish.  Do you mark those two lines)Tj
T*(between your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched,)Tj
T*(sink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried,)Tj
T*(who never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like)Tj

T*(they are not sure of foes.  Don't get the expression of a vicious cur)Tj
T*(that appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all)Tj
T*(the world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even)Tj
T*(forehead,' he replied.  'I do--and that won't help me to them.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if)Tj
T*(you were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into)Tj
T*(something worse than ugly.  And now that we've done washing, and combing,)Tj
T*(and sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?)Tj
T*(I'll tell you, I do.  You're fit for a prince in disguise.  Who knows but)Tj
T*(your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each)Tj
T*(of them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange together?  And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors)Tj
T*(and brought to England.  Were I in your place, I would frame high notions)Tj
T*(of my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and)Tj
T*(dignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to)Tj
T*(look quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by)Tj
T*(a rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.  He ran to)Tj
T*(the window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons)Tj
T*(descend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the)Tj
T*(Earnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in)Tj
T*(winter.  Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them)Tj
T*(into the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour)Tj
T*(into their white faces.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he)Tj
T*(willingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door)Tj
T*(leading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.)Tj
T*(They met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or,)Tj
T*(perhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a)Tj
T*(sudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the)Tj
T*(room--send him into the garret till dinner is over.  He'll be cramming)Tj
T*(his fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them)Tj
T*(a minute.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he:)Tj
T*(and I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till)Tj
T*(dark,' cried Hindley.  'Begone, you vagabond!  What! you are attempting)Tj
T*(the coxcomb, are you?  Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see)Tj
T*(if I won't pull them a bit longer!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the)Tj
T*(doorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache.  It's like a colt's)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(He ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's)Tj
T*(violent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence)Tj
T*(from one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.  He seized a)Tj
T*(tureen of hot apple sauce \(the first thing that came under his gripe\) and)Tj
T*(dashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly)Tj
T*(commenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the)Tj
T*(place.  Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to)Tj

T*(fit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.  I got the dishcloth,)Tj

T*(and rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it)Tj

T*(Cathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton.)Tj
T*('He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be)Tj
T*(flogged: I hate him to be flogged!  I can't eat my dinner.  Why did you)Tj
T*(speak to him, Edgar?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.)Tj
T*(They were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real)Tj

T*(and was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,)Tj
T*(commence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.  'An unfeeling)Tj
T*(child,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old)Tj
T*(playmate's troubles.  I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.')Tj
T*(She lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks)Tj
T*(flushed, and the tears gushed over them.  She slipped her fork to the)Tj
T*(floor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.  I did)Tj
T*(not call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory)Tj
T*(throughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by)Tj
T*(herself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the)Tj
T*(master: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private)Tj
T*(mess of victuals.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In the evening we had a dance.  Cathy begged that he might be liberated)Tj
T*(then, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I)Tj
T*(was appointed to supply the deficiency.  We got rid of all gloom in the)Tj
T*(excitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival)Tj
T*(of the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,)Tj
T*(clarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.)Tj
T*(They go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive)Tj
T*(contributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to)Tj

T*(Mr. Hindley that once.  He went down: I set him a stool by the fire, and)Tj

T*(has nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.  You must come)Tj
T*(home directly.  You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and)Tj

T*('I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks)Tj

T*(spared to leave you this son.  When she came, I felt convinced we)Tj
T*(shouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the)Tj
T*(bairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously.  I, as zealous as)Tj
T*(herself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very)Tj
T*(sad for Hindley's sake.  He had room in his heart only for two idols--his)Tj
T*(wife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't)Tj
T*(conceive how he would bear the loss.)Tj

T*(When we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and,)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Poor soul!  Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed)Tj
T*(her; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her)Tj
T*(health improved every day.  When Kenneth warned him that his medicines)Tj
T*(were useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to)Tj
T*(further expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not--she's)Tj
T*(well--she does not want any more attendance from you!  She never was in a)Tj
T*(consumption.  It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as)Tj
T*(mine now, and her cheek as cool.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one)Tj
T*(night, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought)Tj
T*(she should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her--a)Tj

T*(As the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.)Tj
T*(Mr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was)Tj
T*(contented, as far as regarded him.  For himself, he grew desperate: his)Tj
T*(sorrow was of that kind that will not lament.  He neither wept nor)Tj
T*(prayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up)Tj
T*(to reckless dissipation.  The servants could not bear his tyrannical and)Tj
T*(evil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.  I had)Tj
T*(not the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his)Tj
T*(foster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger)Tj
T*(would.  Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because)Tj
T*(it was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for)Tj
T*(Catherine and Heathcliff.  His treatment of the latter was enough to make)Tj
T*(a fiend of a saint.  And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_)Tj
T*(possessed of something diabolical at that period.  He delighted to)Tj
T*(witness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more)Tj
T*(notable for savage sullenness and ferocity.  I could not half tell what)Tj
T*(an infernal house we had.  The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent)Tj
T*(came near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might)Tj
T*(be an exception.  At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she)Tj
T*(had no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!  I own)Tj
T*(I did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by)Tj
T*(trying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me,)Tj
T*(though.  She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff)Tj
T*(kept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all)Tj
T*(his superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.)Tj
T*(He was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.  It used)Tj

T*(Mr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.  He)Tj
T*(had a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him;)Tj
T*(and yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the)Tj
T*(master himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he)Tj
T*(could not be gracious, kept out of the way.  I rather think his)Tj
T*(appearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never)Tj
T*(played the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends)Tj
T*(meeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his)Tj
T*(presence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and)Tj
T*(when Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not)Tj
T*(treat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her)Tj
T*(playmate were of scarcely any consequence to her.  I've had many a laugh)Tj
T*(at her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide)Tj
T*(from my mockery.  That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became)Tj
T*(really impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened)Tj
T*(into more humility.  She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to)Tj
T*(confide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an)Tj
T*(adviser.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to)Tj
T*(give himself a holiday on the strength of it.  He had reached the age of)Tj
T*(sixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being)Tj
T*(deficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward)Tj
T*(and outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.)Tj
T*(In the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early)Tj
T*(education: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had)Tj
T*(extinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and)Tj
T*(any love for books or learning.  His childhood's sense of superiority,)Tj
T*(instilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.  He)Tj
T*(struggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and)Tj
T*(yielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely;)Tj
T*(and there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving)Tj
T*(upward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former)Tj
T*(level.  Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:)Tj
T*(he acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved)Tj
T*(disposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable)Tj
T*(moroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the)Tj
T*(aversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Catherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite)Tj
T*(from labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words,)Tj
T*(and recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if)Tj
T*(conscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of)Tj
T*(affection on him.  On the before-named occasion he came into the house to)Tj
T*(announce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy)Tj
T*(to arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head)Tj
T*(to be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she)Tj
T*(managed, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and)Tj
T*(was then preparing to receive him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff.  'Are you going)Tj
T*(anywhere?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, it is raining,' she answered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said.  'Nobody coming here, I)Tj
T*(hope?')Tj

T*(now, Heathcliff.  It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were)Tj
T*(gone.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the)Tj
T*(boy.  'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will)Tj
T*(take him till dark, and he'll never know.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.  Catherine reflected an)Tj
T*(instant, with knitted brows--she found it needful to smooth the way for)Tj
T*(an intrusion.  'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this)Tj
T*(afternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence.  'As it)Tj
T*(rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run)Tj
T*(the risk of being scolded for no good.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me)Tj
T*(out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!  I'm on the point,)Tj
T*(sometimes, of complaining that they--but I'll not--')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled)Tj
T*(countenance.  'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away)Tj
T*(from my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl!  That's enough;)Tj
T*(let me alone.  What are you on the point of complaining about,)Tj
T*(Heathcliff?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed)Tj
T*(sheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the)Tj
T*(evenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with)Tj
T*(me.  Do you see?  I've marked every day.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes--very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish)Tj
T*(tone.  'And where is the sense of that?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('To show that I _do_ take notice,' said Heathcliff.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more)Tj
T*(irritated.  'What good do I get?  What do you talk about?  You might be)Tj
T*(dumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you)Tj
T*(do, either!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked)Tj
T*(my company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she)Tj
T*(muttered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Her companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings)Tj
T*(further, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked)Tj
T*(gently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the)Tj
T*(unexpected summon she had received.  Doubtless Catherine marked the)Tj
T*(difference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.)Tj
T*(The contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal)Tj
T*(country for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were)Tj
T*(as opposite as his aspect.  He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and)Tj
T*(pronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and)Tj
T*(softer.)Tj

T*('I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun)Tj
T*(to wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' answered Catherine.  'What are you doing there, Nelly?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('My work, Miss,' I replied.  \(Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make)Tj
T*(a third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.\))Tj

T*('It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded)Tj
T*(assiduously with my occupation.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand,)Tj
T*(and pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm.  I've)Tj
T*(said I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now)Tj
T*(and then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees,)Tj
T*(and screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick!  You have no right to)Tj
T*(nip me, and I'm not going to bear it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling)Tj
T*(to repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.  She never had power to)Tj
T*(conceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to)Tj
T*(refute her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled)Tj
T*(by the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging)Tj
T*(blow that filled both eyes with water.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Catherine, love!  Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the)Tj
T*(double fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Little Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on)Tj
T*(the floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit)Tj

T*(Intelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse,)Tj

T*(CHAPTER IX)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act)Tj
T*(of stowing his son sway in the kitchen cupboard.  Hareton was impressed)Tj
T*(with a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness)Tj
T*(or his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and)Tj
T*(kissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed)Tj
T*(against the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I)Tj
T*(chose to put him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the)Tj
T*(skin of my neck, like a dog.  'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between)Tj
T*(you to murder that child!  I know how it is, now, that he is always out)Tj
T*(of my way.  But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the)Tj
T*(carving-knife, Nelly!  You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth,)Tj
T*(head-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one--and)Tj
T*(I want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has)Tj
T*(been cutting red herrings.  I'd rather be shot, if you please.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall.  No law in England)Tj
T*(can hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable!)Tj
T*(Open your mouth.'  He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point)Tj
T*(between my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his)Tj
T*(vagaries.  I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably--I would not)Tj
T*(take it on any account.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh!' said he, releasing me, 'I see that hideous little villain is not)Tj
T*(Hareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.  If it be, he deserves flaying alive)Tj
T*(for not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.)Tj
T*(Unnatural cub, come hither!  I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted,)Tj
T*(deluded father.  Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?)Tj
T*(It makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce--get me a)Tj
T*(scissors--something fierce and trim!  Besides, it's infernal)Tj
T*(affectation--devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears--we're asses)Tj
T*(enough without them.  Hush, child, hush!  Well then, it is my darling!)Tj
T*(wisht, dry thy eyes--there's a joy; kiss me.  What! it won't?  Kiss me,)Tj
T*(Hareton!  Damn thee, kiss me!  By God, as if I would rear such a monster!)Tj
T*(As sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Poor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his)Tj
T*(might, and redoubled his yells when he carried him up-stairs and lifted)Tj
T*(him over the banister.  I cried out that he would frighten the child into)Tj
T*(fits, and ran to rescue him.  As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on)Tj
T*(the rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in)Tj
T*(his hands.  'Who is that?' he asked, hearing some one approaching the)Tj
T*(stairs'-foot.  I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the)Tj
T*(instant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered)Tj
T*(himself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw)Tj
T*(that the little wretch was safe.  Heathcliff arrived underneath just at)Tj
T*(the critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and)Tj
T*(setting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the)Tj
T*(accident.  A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five)Tj

T*(witnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious)Tj
T*(charge pressed to my heart.  Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of)Tj
T*(sight: you should have taken him from me!  Is he injured anywhere?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot!  Oh!)Tj
T*(I wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.)Tj
T*(You're worse than a heathen--treating your own flesh and blood in that)Tj
T*(manner!'  He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with)Tj
T*(me, sobbed off his terror directly.  At the first finger his father laid)Tj
T*(on him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as)Tj
T*(if he would go into convulsions.)Tj

T*('You shall not meddle with him!' I continued.  'He hates you--they all)Tj

T*('I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man,)Tj

T*(wouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:)Tj
T*(but that's as my fancy goes.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(While saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and)Tj
T*(poured some into a tumbler.)Tj

T*('Nay, don't!' I entreated.  'Mr. Hindley, do take warning.  Have mercy on)Tj

T*(He drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command)Tj
T*(with a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff,)Tj

T*('But it is not for that.  I dreamt once that I was there.')Tj

T*('This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did)Tj

T*(earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the)Tj
T*(middle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing)Tj
T*(for joy.  That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.  I've)Tj

T*('Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an)Tj
T*(opportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.  'If I war)Tj
T*(yah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle)Tj

T*('Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before)Tj
T*(me!  Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who)Tj
T*(told him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as)Tj
T*(you were.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a)Tj
T*(confounded simpleton!  But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were)Tj
T*(you not with Heathcliff last night?  Speak the truth, now.  You need not)Tj

T*(this very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp:)Tj
T*(I shall only have the more humour for you.')Tj

T*('I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob)Tj
T*(bitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him.  But,)Tj
T*(perhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he's gone.'  Here she)Tj
T*(burst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were)Tj
T*(inarticulate.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Hindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to)Tj
T*(her room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing!  I obliged her to)Tj
T*(obey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her)Tj
T*(chamber: it terrified me.  I thought she was going mad, and I begged)Tj
T*(Joseph to run for the doctor.  It proved the commencement of delirium:)Tj
T*(Mr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she)Tj
T*(had a fever.  He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and)Tj
T*(water-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of)Tj
T*(the window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish,)Tj

T*(patient could be, she weathered it through.  Old Mrs. Linton paid us)Tj
T*(several visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and)Tj
T*(ordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on)Tj
T*(conveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very)Tj
T*(grateful.  But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she)Tj
T*(and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each)Tj
T*(other.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Our young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier)Tj
T*(than ever.  Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the)Tj
T*(thunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked)Tj
T*(me exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where)Tj
T*(indeed it belonged, as she well knew.  From that period, for several)Tj
T*(months, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the)Tj
T*(relation of a mere servant.  Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak)Tj
T*(his mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and)Tj
T*(she esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her)Tj
T*(recent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.  Then)Tj
T*(the doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to)Tj
T*(have her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any)Tj
T*(one to presume to stand up and contradict her.  From Mr. Earnshaw and his)Tj
T*(companions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of)Tj
T*(a fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she)Tj
T*(pleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.  He)Tj
T*(was rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,)Tj
T*(but from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family)Tj
T*(by an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she)Tj
T*(might trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!  Edgar Linton, as)Tj
T*(multitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and)Tj
T*(believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to)Tj
T*(Gimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Much against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights)Tj
T*(and accompany her here, Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I)Tj
T*(had just begun to teach him his letters.  We made a sad parting; but)Tj
T*(Catherine's tears were more powerful than ours.  When I refused to go,)Tj
T*(and when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to)Tj
T*(her husband and brother.  The former offered me munificent wages; the)Tj
T*(latter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,)Tj
T*(now that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take)Tj
T*(him in hand, by-and-by.  And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was)Tj
T*(ordered.  I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run)Tj
T*(to ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then)Tj
T*(he has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no)Tj
T*(doubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was)Tj
T*(ever more than all the world to her and she to him!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(* * * * *)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards)Tj
T*(the time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the)Tj
T*(minute-hand measure half-past one.  She would not hear of staying a)Tj
T*(second longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of)Tj
T*(her narrative myself.  And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I)Tj
T*(have meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go)Tj
T*(also, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.)Tj

T*(CHAPTER X)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A charming introduction to a hermit's life!  Four weeks' torture,)Tj
T*(tossing, and sickness!  Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,)Tj
T*(and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons!  And oh, this dearth)Tj
T*(of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of)Tj
T*(Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.  About seven days ago he)Tj
T*(sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season.  Scoundrel!  He is not)Tj
T*(altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind)Tj
T*(to tell him.  But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable)Tj
T*(enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject)Tj
T*(than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?  This is quite an easy)Tj
T*(interval.  I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy)Tj
T*(something interesting.  Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?  I)Tj
T*(can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.  Yes: I)Tj
T*(remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;)Tj
T*(and the heroine was married.  I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me)Tj
T*(capable of talking cheerfully.  Mrs. Dean came.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,' she commenced.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Away, away with it!' I replied; 'I desire to have--')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The doctor says you must drop the powders.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('With all my heart!  Don't interrupt me.  Come and take your seat here.)Tj
T*(Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.  Draw your knitting)Tj
T*(out of your pocket--that will do--now continue the history of Mr.)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day.  Did he finish)Tj
T*(his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he get)Tj
T*(a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by)Tj
T*(drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on)Tj
T*(the English highways?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I)Tj
T*(couldn't give my word for any.  I stated before that I didn't know how he)Tj
T*(gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his)Tj
T*(mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your)Tj
T*(leave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not)Tj
T*(weary you.  Are you feeling better this morning?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Much.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That's good news.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(* * * * *)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my)Tj
T*(agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to)Tj
T*(expect.  She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his)Tj
T*(sister she showed plenty of affection.  They were both very attentive to)Tj
T*(her comfort, certainly.  It was not the thorn bending to the)Tj
T*(honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.  There were no)Tj
T*(mutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can)Tj
T*(be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition)Tj
T*(nor indifference?  I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of)Tj
T*(ruffling her humour.  He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me)Tj

T*(answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious)Tj
T*(order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that)Tj
T*(never darkened on his own account.  He many a time spoke sternly to me)Tj
T*(about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict)Tj
T*(a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.  Not to grieve a)Tj
T*(kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a)Tj
T*(year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to)Tj
T*(explode it.  Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then:)Tj
T*(they were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who)Tj
T*(ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her)Tj
T*(perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits)Tj
T*(before.  The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from)Tj
T*(him.  I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep)Tj
T*(and growing happiness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It ended.  Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and)Tj
T*(generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended)Tj
T*(when circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not)Tj
T*(the chief consideration in the other's thoughts.  On a mellow evening in)Tj
T*(September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples)Tj
T*(which I had been gathering.  It had got dusk, and the moon looked over)Tj
T*(the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the)Tj
T*(corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.  I set my)Tj
T*(burden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and)Tj
T*(drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the)Tj
T*(moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me)Tj
T*(say,--'Nelly, is that you?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the)Tj
T*(manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.  I turned)Tj
T*(about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I)Tj
T*(had seen nobody on approaching the steps.  Something stirred in the)Tj
T*(porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark)Tj
T*(clothes, with dark face and hair.  He leant against the side, and held)Tj
T*(his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.  'Who can)Tj
T*(it be?' I thought.  'Mr. Earnshaw?  Oh, no!  The voice has no resemblance)Tj
T*(to his.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; 'and)Tj
T*(the whole of that time all round has been as still as death.  I dared not)Tj
T*(enter.  You do not know me?  Look, I'm not a stranger!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with)Tj
T*(black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular.  I)Tj
T*(remembered the eyes.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,)Tj
T*(and I raised my hands in amazement.  'What! you come back?  Is it really)Tj
T*(you?  Is it?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which)Tj
T*(reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.)Tj
T*('Are they at home? where is she?  Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be)Tj
T*(so disturbed.  Is she here?  Speak!  I want to have one word with)Tj
T*(her--your mistress.  Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to)Tj
T*(see her.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How will she take it?' I exclaimed.  'What will she do?  The surprise)Tj
T*(bewilders me--it will put her out of her head!  And you _are_ Heathcliff!)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently.  'I'm in hell)Tj
T*(till you do!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where)Tj
T*(Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.  At)Tj
T*(length I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the)Tj
T*(candles lighted, and I opened the door.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,)Tj
T*(and displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the)Tj
T*(valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top)Tj
T*(\(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the)Tj
T*(sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of)Tj
T*(the glen\).  Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old)Tj
T*(house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.  Both the)Tj
T*(room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously)Tj
T*(peaceful.  I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was)Tj
T*(actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about)Tj
T*(the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,)Tj
T*('A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What does he want?' asked Mrs. Linton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I did not question him,' I answered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea.  I'll be)Tj
T*(back again directly.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Some one mistress does not expect,' I replied.  'That Heathcliff--you)Tj
T*(recollect him, sir--who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried.  'Why did you not say so to)Tj
T*(Catherine?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said.  'She'd be)Tj
T*(sadly grieved to hear you.  She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.  I)Tj
T*(guess his return will make a jubilee to her.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that)Tj
T*(overlooked the court.  He unfastened it, and leant out.  I suppose they)Tj
T*(were below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'Don't stand there, love!  Bring)Tj
T*(the person in, if it be anyone particular.'  Ere long, I heard the click)Tj
T*(of the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too)Tj
T*(excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have)Tj
T*(surmised an awful calamity.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.  'Oh,)Tj
T*(Edgar darling!  Heathcliff's come back--he is!'  And she tightened her)Tj
T*(embrace to a squeeze.)Tj

T*('Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that!  He)Tj
T*(never struck me as such a marvellous treasure.  There is no need to be)Tj

T*(intensity of her delight.  'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.)Tj

T*(Shall I tell him to come up?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Where else?' she asked.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for)Tj
T*(him.  Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half)Tj
T*(laughing at his fastidiousness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' she added, after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen.  Set two)Tj
T*(tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry;)Tj
T*(the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.  Will)Tj
T*(that please you, dear?  Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?  If so,)Tj
T*(give directions.  I'll run down and secure my guest.  I'm afraid the joy)Tj
T*(is too great to be real!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('_You_ bid him step up,' he said, addressing me; 'and, Catherine, try to)Tj
T*(be glad, without being absurd.  The whole household need not witness the)Tj
T*(sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently)Tj
T*(anticipating an invitation to enter.  He followed my guidance without)Tj
T*(waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and)Tj
T*(mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.  But the)Tj
T*(lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door:)Tj
T*(she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then)Tj
T*(she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.  Now,)Tj
T*(fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever,)Tj
T*(to behold the transformation of Heathcliff.  He had grown a tall,)Tj
T*(athletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and)Tj
T*(youth-like.  His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been)Tj
T*(in the army.  His countenance was much older in expression and decision)Tj
T*(of feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no)Tj
T*(marks of former degradation.  A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the)Tj
T*(depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his)Tj
T*(manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for)Tj
T*(grace.  My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a)Tj
T*(minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.)Tj
T*(Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till)Tj
T*(he chose to speak.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Sit down, sir,' he said, at length.  'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,)Tj
T*(would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am)Tj
T*(gratified when anything occurs to please her.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And I also,' answered Heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which)Tj
T*(I have a part.  I shall stay an hour or two willingly.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if)Tj
T*(she feared he would vanish were she to remove it.  He did not raise his)Tj
T*(to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,)Tj
T*(each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.)Tj
T*(They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.)Tj
T*(Not so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that)Tj
T*(reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug,)Tj
T*(seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.)Tj

T*('I shall think it a dream to-morrow!' she cried.  'I shall not be able to)Tj
T*(believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.  And)Tj
T*(yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome.  To be absent and)Tj
T*(silent for three years, and never to think of me!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured.  'I heard of)Tj
T*(your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard)Tj
T*(below, I meditated this plan--just to have one glimpse of your face, a)Tj
T*(stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my)Tj
T*(score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on)Tj
T*(myself.  Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of)Tj
T*(meeting me with another aspect next time!  Nay, you'll not drive me off)Tj
T*(again.  You were really sorry for me, were you?  Well, there was cause.)Tj
T*(I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you)Tj
T*(must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,')Tj

T*(measure of politeness.  'Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever)Tj
T*(he may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the)Tj
T*(bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.  The)Tj
T*(meal hardly endured ten minutes.  Catherine's cup was never filled: she)Tj
T*(could neither eat nor drink.  Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and)Tj
T*(scarcely swallowed a mouthful.  Their guest did not protract his stay)Tj
T*(that evening above an hour longer.  I asked, as he departed, if he went)Tj
T*(to Gimmerton?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: 'Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I)Tj
T*(called this morning.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!  I pondered)Tj
T*(this sentence painfully, after he was gone.  Is he turning out a bit of a)Tj
T*(hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak?  I)Tj
T*(mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better)Tj

T*(might improve them all the same.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' said I.  'They humour you: I know what)Tj
T*(there would be to do if they did not.  You can well afford to indulge)Tj
T*(their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your)Tj

T*('I do,' she answered, 'but he needn't resort to whining for trifles.  It)Tj
T*(is childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that)Tj
T*(Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the)Tj
T*(first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it)Tj
T*(for me, and been delighted from sympathy.  He must get accustomed to him,)Tj

T*(object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!')Tj

T*(resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to)Tj
T*(questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;)Tj
T*(and finally, desired him to walk in.  There were some persons sitting at)Tj
T*(cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,)Tj
T*(finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again)Tj
T*(in the evening: to which he consented.  Hindley is too reckless to select)Tj
T*(his acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the)Tj
T*(causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.  But)Tj
T*(Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with)Tj
T*(his ancient persecutor is a wish to instal himself in quarters at walking)Tj
T*(distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived)Tj
T*(together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of)Tj
T*(seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton.  He means)Tj
T*(to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her)Tj
T*(fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only)Tj
T*(abjured his peevishness \(though his spirits seemed still subdued by)Tj
T*(Catherine's exuberance of vivacity\), but he ventured no objection to her)Tj
T*(taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she)Tj
T*(rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as)Tj
T*(made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants)Tj
T*(profiting from the perpetual sunshine.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff--Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of)Tj
T*(visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating)Tj
T*(how far its owner would bear his intrusion.  Catherine, also, deemed it)Tj
T*(judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and)Tj
T*(he gradually established his right to be expected.  He retained a great)Tj
T*(deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served)Tj
T*(to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.  My master's)Tj
T*(uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into)Tj
T*(another channel for a space.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of)Tj
T*(Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the)Tj
T*(tolerated guest.  She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;)Tj
T*(infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a)Tj
T*(keen temper, too, if irritated.  Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was)Tj
T*(appalled at this fantastic preference.  Leaving aside the degradation of)Tj
T*(an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property,)Tj
T*(in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had)Tj
T*(sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his)Tj
T*(exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.  And he)Tj
T*(dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea)Tj
T*(of committing Isabella to its keeping.  He would have recoiled still more)Tj
T*(had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed)Tj
T*(where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he)Tj
T*(discovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate)Tj
T*(designing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined)Tj
T*(over something.  She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing)Tj

T*(Sometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a)Tj
T*(sudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.)Tj
T*(I've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people)Tj
T*(talked regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad)Tj
T*(habits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering)Tj
T*(the dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to)Tj
T*(Gimmerton.  It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a)Tj
T*(bright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry.  I)Tj
T*(came to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your)Tj
T*(left hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north)Tj
T*(side, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G.  It serves as a guide-)Tj
T*(post to the Grange, the Heights, and village.  The sun shone yellow on)Tj
T*(its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all at)Tj
T*(once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart.  Hindley and I)Tj
T*(held it a favourite spot twenty years before.  I gazed long at the)Tj
T*(weather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom)Tj
T*(still full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing)Tj
T*(there with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared)Tj
T*(that I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark,)Tj
T*(square head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth with)Tj
T*(a piece of slate.  'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily.  I)Tj
T*(started: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the child)Tj
T*(lifted its face and stared straight into mine!  It vanished in a)Tj
T*(twinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the)Tj
T*(Heights.  Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he)Tj
T*(should be dead!  I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign)Tj
T*(of death!  The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on)Tj
T*(catching sight of it I trembled in every limb.  The apparition had)Tj
T*(outstripped me: it stood looking through the gate.  That was my first)Tj
T*(idea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy)Tj
T*(countenance against the bars.  Further reflection suggested this must be)Tj
T*(Hareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months)Tj
T*(since.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('God bless thee, darling!' I cried, forgetting instantaneously my foolish)Tj
T*(fears.  'Hareton, it's Nelly!  Nelly, thy nurse.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I am come to see thy father, Hareton,' I added, guessing from the action)Tj
T*(that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised as one)Tj
T*(with me.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but)Tj
T*(could not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,)Tj
T*(from the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which,)Tj
T*(whether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised)Tj
T*(emphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of)Tj
T*(malignity.  You may be certain this grieved more than angered me.  Fit to)Tj
T*(cry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.)Tj
T*(He hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only)Tj
T*(intended to tempt and disappoint him.  I showed another, keeping it out)Tj
T*(of his reach.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?' I inquired.  'The)Tj
T*(curate?')Tj

T*('Damn the curate, and thee!  Gie me that,' he replied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,' said I.)Tj
T*('Who's your master?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Devil daddy,' was his answer.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And what do you learn from daddy?' I continued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.  'What does he teach you?' I)Tj
T*(asked.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Naught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait.  Daddy cannot bide me,)Tj
T*(because I swear at him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?' I observed.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ay--nay,' he drawled.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Who, then?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Heathcliff.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ay!' he answered again.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Desiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the)Tj
T*(sentences--'I known't: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he curses)Tj
T*(daddy for cursing me.  He says I mun do as I will.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?' I pursued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, I was told the curate should have his--teeth dashed down his--throat,)Tj
T*(if he stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman)Tj
T*(called Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.  He)Tj
T*(went up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,)Tj
T*(Heathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran)Tj
T*(down the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained)Tj
T*(the guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.  This)Tj
T*(is not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged)Tj
T*(me to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to)Tj
T*(cheek the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I)Tj
T*(should wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some)Tj
T*(pigeons in the court.  She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law)Tj
T*(for three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and)Tj
T*(we found it a great comfort.  Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a)Tj
T*(single unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.  Now, as soon as he)Tj
T*(beheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the)Tj
T*(house-front.  I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of)Tj
T*(sight.  He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something:)Tj
T*(she seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he)Tj
T*(laid his hand on her arm.  She averted her face: he apparently put some)Tj
T*(question which she had no mind to answer.  There was another rapid glance)Tj
T*(at the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the)Tj
T*(impudence to embrace her.)Tj

T*('Judas!  Traitor!' I ejaculated.  'You are a hypocrite, too, are you?  A)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Who is, Nelly?' said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been)Tj

T*('Hush!' said Catherine, shutting the inner door!  'Don't vex me.  Why)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('What is it to you?' he growled.  'I have a right to kiss her, if she)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I'm not jealous of you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you.)Tj
T*(Clear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me!  If you like Isabella, you)Tj

T*(There, you won't answer.  I'm certain you don't.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' I)Tj
T*(inquired.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He might spare himself the trouble,' said Heathcliff: 'I could do as)Tj

T*('I seek no revenge on you,' replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.  'That's)Tj
T*(not the plan.  The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn)Tj
T*(against him; they crush those beneath them.  You are welcome to torture)Tj
T*(me to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in)Tj
T*(the same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able.  Having)Tj
T*(levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own)Tj
T*(charity in giving me that for a home.  If I imagined you really wished me)Tj
T*(to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?' cried Catherine.  'Well,)Tj
T*(I won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost)Tj
T*(soul.  Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.  You prove it.)Tj
T*(Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I)Tj
T*(begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,)Tj
T*(appear resolved on exciting a quarrel.  Quarrel with Edgar, if you)Tj
T*(please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the)Tj
T*(most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The conversation ceased.  Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and)Tj
T*(gloomy.  The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could)Tj
T*(neither lay nor control it.  He stood on the hearth with folded arms,)Tj
T*(brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek)Tj
T*(the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' I answered.  'She's sadly put out by)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange)Tj
T*(his visits on another footing.  There's harm in being too soft, and now)Tj
T*(it's come to this--.'  And I related the scene in the court, and, as near)Tj
T*(as I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.  I fancied it could not be very)Tj
T*(prejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming)Tj
T*(the defensive for her guest.  Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me)Tj
T*(to the close.  His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of)Tj
T*(blame.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('This is insufferable!' he exclaimed.  'It is disgraceful that she should)Tj
T*(own him for a friend, and force his company on me!  Call me two men out)Tj
T*(of the hall, Ellen.  Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the)Tj
T*(low ruffian--I have humoured her enough.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,)Tj
T*(followed by me, to the kitchen.  Its occupants had recommenced their)Tj
T*(angry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed)Tj
T*(vigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat)Tj
T*(cowed by her violent rating apparently.  He saw the master first, and)Tj
T*(made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,)Tj
T*(abruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How is this?' said Linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety)Tj
T*(must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to)Tj
T*(you by that blackguard?  I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you)Tj
T*(think nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,)Tj
T*(imagine I can get used to it too!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?' asked the mistress, in a)Tj
T*(tone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both)Tj
T*(carelessness and contempt of his irritation.  Heathcliff, who had raised)Tj
T*(his eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on)Tj
T*(purpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him.  He succeeded;)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that I)Tj

T*(only partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry)Tj
T*(surprise.  'If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or)Tj
T*(allow yourself to be beaten.  It will correct you of feigning more valour)Tj
T*(than you possess.  No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it!  I'm)Tj
T*(delightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!  After constant indulgence)Tj
T*(of one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two)Tj
T*(samples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!  Edgar, I was)Tj
T*(defending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for)Tj
T*(daring to think an evil thought of me!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the)Tj
T*(master.  He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety)Tj
T*(she flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was)Tj
T*(taken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.  For)Tj
T*(his life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and)Tj
T*(humiliation overcame him completely.  He leant on the back of a chair,)Tj
T*(and covered his face.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, heavens!  In old days this would win you knighthood!' exclaimed Mrs.)Tj
T*(Linton.  'We are vanquished! we are vanquished!  Heathcliff would as soon)Tj
T*(lift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of)Tj
T*(mice.  Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt!  Your type is not a lamb, it's a)Tj

T*(The fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.)Tj
T*(He'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and)Tj

T*(a string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and)Tj
T*(God knows where we should end!  Will you do so, my good Nelly?  You are)Tj
T*(aware that I am no way blamable in this matter.  What possessed him to)Tj
T*(turn listener?  Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but)Tj
T*(I could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.)Tj
T*(Now all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that)Tj

T*(conversation, he would never have been the worse for it.  Really, when he)Tj
T*(opened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded)Tj
T*(Heathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care hardly what they did)Tj
T*(to each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we)Tj

T*(There she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding)Tj
T*(her teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!  Mr.)Tj
T*(Linton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.  He told me)Tj
T*(to fetch some water.  She had no breath for speaking.  I brought a glass)Tj
T*(full; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face.  In a few)Tj
T*(seconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while)Tj
T*(her cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.)Tj
T*(Linton looked terrified.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('There is nothing in the world the matter,' I whispered.  I did not want)Tj
T*(him to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She has blood on her lips!' he said, shuddering.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Never mind!' I answered, tartly.  And I told him how she had resolved,)Tj
T*(previous to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy.  I incautiously)Tj
T*(gave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up--her hair)Tj
T*(flying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck and)Tj
T*(arms standing out preternaturally.  I made up my mind for broken bones,)Tj
T*(at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then rushed)Tj
T*(from the room.  The master directed me to follow; I did, to her chamber-)Tj
T*(door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(As she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask)Tj
T*(whether she would have some carried up.  'No!' she replied, peremptorily.)Tj
T*(The same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow)Tj
T*(after, and received the same answer.  Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his)Tj
T*(time in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's)Tj
T*(occupations.  Isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which)Tj
T*(he tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for)Tj
T*(Heathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies,)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XII)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(While Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and)Tj
T*(almost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that)Tj
T*(he never opened--wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation)Tj
T*(that Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to)Tj
T*(ask pardon, and seek a reconciliation--and _she_ fasted pertinaciously,)Tj
T*(under the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for)Tj
T*(her absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her)Tj
T*(feet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but)Tj
T*(one sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  I wasted no)Tj
T*(condolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay)Tj
T*(much attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's)Tj
T*(name, since he might not hear her voice.  I determined they should come)Tj
T*(about as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow)Tj
T*(process, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as)Tj
T*(I thought at first.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the)Tj
T*(water in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin)Tj
T*(of gruel, for she believed she was dying.  That I set down as a speech)Tj
T*(meant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself)Tj
T*(and brought her some tea and dry toast.  She ate and drank eagerly, and)Tj
T*(sank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.  'Oh, I)Tj
T*(will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.  I wish)Tj
T*(I had not taken that.'  Then a good while after I heard her murmur, 'No,)Tj
T*(I'll not die--he'd be glad--he does not love me at all--he would never)Tj
T*(miss me!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Did you want anything, ma'am?' I inquired, still preserving my external)Tj
T*(composure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated)Tj
T*(manner.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick)Tj
T*(entangled locks from her wasted face.  'Has he fallen into a lethargy, or)Tj
T*(is he dead?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Neither,' replied I; 'if you mean Mr. Linton.  He's tolerably well, I)Tj
T*(think, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is)Tj
T*(continually among his books, since he has no other society.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I)Tj
T*(could not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Among his books!' she cried, confounded.  'And I dying!  I on the brink)Tj
T*(of the grave!  My God! does he know how I'm altered?' continued she,)Tj
T*(staring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.)Tj
T*('Is that Catherine Linton?   He imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.)Tj
T*(Cannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?  Nelly, if it be not)Tj
T*(too late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two:)Tj

T*(life?')Tj

T*('Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged;)Tj
T*(and of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You think not?  Cannot you tell him I will?' she returned.  'Persuade)Tj
T*(him! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some)Tj
T*(food with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good)Tj
T*(effects.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('If I were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'I'd kill)Tj
T*(myself directly!  These three awful nights I've never closed my lids--and)Tj
T*(oh, I've been tormented!  I've been haunted, Nelly!  But I begin to fancy)Tj
T*(you don't like me.  How strange!  I thought, though everybody hated and)Tj
T*(despised each other, they could not avoid loving me.  And they have all)Tj
T*(turned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people)Tj
T*(here.  How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!)Tj
T*(Isabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be)Tj
T*(so dreadful to watch Catherine go.  And Edgar standing solemnly by to see)Tj
T*(it over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to)Tj
T*(his house, and going back to his _books_!  What in the name of all that)Tj
T*(feels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?')Tj

T*(She could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.)Tj
T*(Linton's philosophical resignation.  Tossing about, she increased her)Tj
T*(feverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;)Tj
T*(then raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the)Tj
T*(window.  We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the)Tj
T*(north-east, and I objected.  Both the expressions flitting over her face,)Tj
T*(and the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to)Tj
T*(my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she)Tj
T*(should not be crossed.  A minute previously she was violent; now,)Tj
T*(supported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed)Tj
T*(to find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had)Tj
T*(just made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different)Tj
T*(species: her mind had strayed to other associations.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself; 'and this is a wild duck's;)Tj
T*(and this is a pigeon's.  Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows--no)Tj
T*(wonder I couldn't die!  Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I)Tj
T*(lie down.  And here is a moor-cock's; and this--I should know it among a)Tj
T*(thousand--it's a lapwing's.  Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the)Tj
T*(middle of the moor.  It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had)Tj
T*(touched the swells, and it felt rain coming.  This feather was picked up)Tj
T*(from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,)Tj
T*(full of little skeletons.  Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old)Tj
T*(ones dared not come.  I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after)Tj
T*(that, and he didn't.  Yes, here are more!  Did he shoot my lapwings,)Tj
T*(Nelly?  Are they red, any of them?  Let me look.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow away,)Tj
T*(and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its)Tj
T*(contents by handfuls.  'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering.)Tj
T*(There's a mess!  The down is flying about like snow.')Tj

T*(and Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room)Tj
T*(desperate.  As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness)Tj
T*(overwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor.  I couldn't explain to Edgar how)Tj
T*(certain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in)Tj
T*(teasing me!  I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess)Tj
T*(my agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and)Tj

T*(the grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled)Tj
T*(bed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just waking,)Tj
T*(I could not recollect.  I pondered, and worried myself to discover what)Tj
T*(it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven years of my life)Tj
T*(grew a blank!  I did not recall that they had been at all.  I was a)Tj
T*(child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from the separation)Tj
T*(that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff.  I was laid alone,)Tj
T*(for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a night of)Tj
T*(weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck the table-)Tj
T*(top!  I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my late)Tj
T*(anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.  I cannot say why I felt)Tj
T*(so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for there is)Tj
T*(scarcely cause.  But, supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched)Tj
T*(from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in all, as)Tj
T*(Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into Mrs.)Tj

T*(them!  Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult)Tj

T*(event; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I)Tj
T*(quitted the chamber.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(In passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook)Tj
T*(is driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,)Tj
T*(evidently by another agent than the wind.  Notwithstanding my hurry, I)Tj
T*(stayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction)Tj
T*(impressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.  My)Tj
T*(surprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than)Tj
T*(vision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and)Tj
T*(nearly at its last gasp.  I quickly released the animal, and lifted it)Tj
T*(into the garden.  I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she)Tj
T*(went to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what)Tj
T*(mischievous person had treated it so.  While untying the knot round the)Tj
T*(hook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet)Tj
T*(galloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to)Tj
T*(occupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought:)Tj
T*(though it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the)Tj
T*(morning.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient)Tj
T*(in the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine)Tj
T*(Linton's malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.  He was a)Tj
T*(plain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her)Tj
T*(surviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his)Tj
T*(directions than she had shown herself before.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nelly Dean,' said he, 'I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for)Tj
T*(this.  What has there been to do at the Grange?  We've odd reports up)Tj
T*(here.  A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a)Tj
T*(trifle; and that sort of people should not either.  It's hard work)Tj
T*(bringing them through fevers, and such things.  How did it begin?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The master will inform you,' I answered; 'but you are acquainted with)Tj
T*(the Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.  I)Tj
T*(may say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  She was struck during a tempest)Tj
T*(of passion with a kind of fit.  That's her account, at least: for she)Tj
T*(flew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.  Afterwards, she)Tj
T*(refused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half)Tj
T*(dream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts)Tj
T*(of strange ideas and illusions.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Linton will be sorry?' observed Kenneth, interrogatively.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied.  'Don't)Tj
T*(alarm him more than necessary.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the)Tj
T*(consequences of neglecting my warning!  Hasn't he been intimate with Mr.)Tj
T*(Heathcliff lately?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,' answered I, 'though more on)Tj
T*(the strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because)Tj
T*(the master likes his company.  At present he's discharged from the)Tj
T*(trouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss)Tj
T*(Linton which he manifested.  I hardly think he'll be taken in again.')Tj

T*('And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next)Tj
T*(question.)Tj

T*('I'm not in her confidence,' returned I, reluctant to continue the)Tj
T*(subject.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head.  'She keeps her own)Tj
T*(counsel!  But she's a real little fool.  I have it from good authority)Tj
T*(that last night \(and a pretty night it was!\) she and Heathcliff were)Tj
T*(walking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and)Tj
T*(he pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with)Tj
T*(him!  My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word)Tj
T*(of honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was)Tj
T*(to be he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most)Tj
T*(of the way back.  The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.  I spared)Tj
T*(a minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,)Tj
T*(it coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the)Tj
T*(road, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.  On ascending to)Tj
T*(Isabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty.  Had I been)Tj
T*(a few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her rash)Tj
T*(step.  But what could be done now?  There was a bare possibility of)Tj
T*(overtaking them if pursued instantly.  _I_ could not pursue them,)Tj
T*(however; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with)Tj
T*(confusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he)Tj
T*(was in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second)Tj
T*(grief!  I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to)Tj
T*(take their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly)Tj
T*(composed countenance to announce him.  Catherine lay in a troubled sleep:)Tj
T*(her husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung)Tj
T*(over her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully)Tj
T*(expressive features.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of)Tj
T*(its having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her)Tj
T*(perfect and constant tranquillity.  To me, he signified the threatening)Tj
T*(danger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never)Tj
T*(went to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,)Tj
T*(moving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as)Tj
T*(they encountered each other in their vocations.  Every one was active but)Tj
T*(Miss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother,)Tj
T*(too, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and)Tj
T*(hurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  I trembled)Tj
T*(lest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being)Tj
T*(the first proclaimant of her flight.  One of the maids, a thoughtless)Tj
T*(girl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting)Tj
T*(up-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear,)Tj
T*(dear!  What mun we have next?  Master, master, our young lady--')Tj

T*('Hold your noise!' cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.)Tj

T*(your young lady?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She's gone, she's gone!  Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the)Tj
T*(girl.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That is not true!' exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.  'It cannot)Tj

T*(As he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand)Tj
T*(to know her reasons for such an assertion.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered,)Tj
T*('and he asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange.  I thought he)Tj
T*(meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes.  Then says he, "There's)Tj
T*(somebody gone after 'em, I guess?"  I stared.  He saw I knew nought about)Tj
T*(it, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's)Tj
T*(shoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not)Tj
T*(very long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy)Tj
T*(who they were: she knew them both directly.  And she noticed the)Tj
T*(man--Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob'dy could mistake him,)Tj
T*(besides--put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment.  The lady had)Tj
T*(a cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she)Tj
T*(drank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.  Heathcliff held both)Tj
T*(bridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and)Tj
T*(went as fast as the rough roads would let them.  The lass said nothing to)Tj
T*(her father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when)Tj
T*(I returned, the servant's statement.  Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by)Tj
T*(the bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my)Tj
T*(blank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a)Tj
T*(word.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' I)Tj
T*(inquired.  'How should we do?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go)Tj

T*(than Edgar tended her.  Day and night he was watching, and patiently)Tj

T*(The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the)Tj
T*(following March.  Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a)Tj
T*(handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of)Tj
T*(pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them)Tj
T*(eagerly together.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed.  'They)Tj
T*(remind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.)Tj
T*(Edgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and I)Tj
T*(only see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue,)Tj
T*(and the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.)Tj
T*(Catherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this)Tj
T*(roof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so)Tj
T*(sweetly, I feel that it would cure you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then)Tj
T*(you'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.  Next spring you'll long)Tj
T*(again to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were)Tj
T*(happy to-day.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by)Tj
T*(the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears)Tj
T*(collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.  We knew she)Tj
T*(was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a)Tj
T*(single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially)Tj
T*(removed by a change of scene.  The master told me to light a fire in the)Tj
T*(many-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by)Tj
T*(the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while)Tj
T*(enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects)Tj
T*(round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations)Tj
T*(investing her hated sick chamber.  By evening she seemed greatly)Tj
T*(exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that)Tj
T*(apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till)Tj
T*(another room could be prepared.  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and)Tj
T*(descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on)Tj
T*(the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move)Tj
T*(from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.  Ah, I thought myself, she)Tj
T*(might recover, so waited on as she was.  And there was double cause to)Tj
T*(desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished)Tj
T*(the hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,)Tj
T*(and his lands secured from a stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from)Tj
T*(her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.  It)Tj
T*(appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an)Tj
T*(obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,)Tj
T*(if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it)Tj
T*(then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.  Linton did not)Tj
T*(reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,)Tj
T*(which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the)Tj

T*(explain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see)Tj
T*(me; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.  Don't write, but come, and)Tj

T*(Now, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led)Tj

T*(thoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.  I should laugh and)Tj

T*(the rest was an unnatural dream!)Tj

T*(The sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I)Tj
T*(judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to)Tj
T*(inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as)Tj
T*(well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of)Tj
T*(the farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to)Tj
T*(receive us by the light of a dip candle.  He did it with a courtesy that)Tj
T*(redounded to his credit.  His first act was to elevate his torch to a)Tj
T*(level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn)Tj
T*(away.  Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;)Tj

T*(I was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the)Tj
T*(strangest tone--'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your)Tj
T*(bolt--don't omit it!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well!' I said.  'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?'  I did not relish the notion of)Tj
T*(deliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a)Tj
T*(curiously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached)Tj
T*(to the barrel.  'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?  I)Tj
T*(cannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.  If)Tj
T*(once I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the)Tj
T*(minute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me)Tj
T*(refrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by)Tj
T*(killing him.  You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;)Tj
T*(when the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I surveyed the weapon inquisitively.  A hideous notion struck me: how)Tj
T*(powerful I should be possessing such an instrument!  I took it from his)Tj
T*(hand, and touched the blade.  He looked astonished at the expression my)Tj
T*(face assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was)Tj
T*(covetousness.  He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,)Tj
T*(and returned it to its concealment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I don't care if you tell him,' said he.  'Put him on his guard, and)Tj
T*(watch for him.  You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not)Tj

T*('What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked.  'In what has he wronged you,)Tj
T*(to warrant this appalling hatred?  Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit)Tj
T*(the house?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No!' thundered Earnshaw; 'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man:)Tj
T*(persuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!  Am I to lose _all_,)Tj
T*(without a chance of retrieval?  Is Hareton to be a beggar?  Oh,)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(You've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits.  He is)Tj
T*(clearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.  I)Tj
T*(shuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred)Tj
T*(moroseness as comparatively agreeable.  He now recommenced his moody)Tj
T*(walk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.  Joseph was)Tj
T*(bending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and)Tj
T*(a wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.  The contents of)Tj
T*(the pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I)Tj
T*(conjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being)Tj
T*(hungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_)Tj
T*(make the porridge!'  I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded)Tj
T*(to take off my hat and riding-habit.  'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued,)Tj

T*(This lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing)Tj
T*(to remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled)Tj
T*(speedily to drive off the remembrance.  It racked me to recall past)Tj
T*(happiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,)Tj
T*(the quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal)Tj

T*(It _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four)Tj

T*(dairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the)Tj
T*(expansive lip.  I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a)Tj

T*(old cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,)Tj
T*(repeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as)Tj
T*(wollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.)Tj

T*(pride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.)Tj
T*(An unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I)Tj
T*(now recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood at)Tj
T*(the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley.  I fancy it knew)Tj
T*(me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then hastened)Tj
T*(to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step, collecting the)Tj
T*(shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk from the banister)Tj
T*(with my pocket-handkerchief.  Our labours were scarcely over when I heard)Tj
T*(Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked in his tail, and)Tj
T*(pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.  The dog's)Tj
T*(endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a scutter down-)Tj
T*(stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping.  I had better luck: he passed)Tj
T*(on, entered his chamber, and shut the door.  Directly after Joseph came)Tj
T*(up with Hareton, to put him to bed.  I had found shelter in Hareton's)Tj
T*(room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's rahm for boath ye un')Tj

T*(Gladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung)Tj
T*(myself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.  My slumber was)Tj
T*(deep and sweet, though over far too soon.  Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he)Tj
T*(had just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing)Tj
T*(there?  I told him the cause of my staying up so late--that he had the)Tj
T*(key of our room in his pocket.  The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.)Tj
T*(He swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd--but I'll not)Tj
T*(repeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious)Tj
T*(and unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!  I sometimes wonder at)Tj
T*(him with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or)Tj
T*(a venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he)Tj
T*(wakens.  He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of)Tj
T*(causing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he)Tj
T*(could get hold of him.)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XIV)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(As soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed)Tj
T*(him that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter)Tj
T*(expressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire)Tj
T*(to see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as)Tj
T*(possible, some token of forgiveness by me.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Forgiveness!' said Linton.  'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.  You)Tj
T*(may call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I)Tj
T*(am not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never)Tj
T*(think she'll be happy.  It is out of the question my going to see her,)Tj
T*(however: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige)Tj
T*(me, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' he answered.  'It is needless.  My communication with Heathcliff's)Tj
T*(family shall be as sparing as his with mine.  It shall not exist!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the)Tj
T*(Grange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when)Tj
T*(I repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to)Tj
T*(console Isabella.  I daresay she had been on the watch for me since)Tj
T*(morning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden)Tj
T*(causeway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being)Tj
T*(observed.  I entered without knocking.  There never was such a dreary,)Tj
T*(dismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented!  I must confess,)Tj
T*(that if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have)Tj
T*(swept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster.  But she already)Tj
T*(partook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her.  Her)Tj
T*(pretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging)Tj
T*(lankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head.  Probably she)Tj
T*(had not touched her dress since yester evening.  Hindley was not there.)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his pocket-)Tj
T*(book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite friendly,)Tj
T*(and offered me a chair.  He was the only thing there that seemed decent;)Tj
T*(and I thought he never looked better.  So much had circumstances altered)Tj
T*(their positions, that he would certainly have struck a stranger as a born)Tj
T*(and bred gentleman; and his wife as a thorough little slattern!  She came)Tj
T*(forward eagerly to greet me, and held out one hand to take the expected)Tj
T*(letter.  I shook my head.  She wouldn't understand the hint, but followed)Tj
T*(me to a sideboard, where I went to lay my bonnet, and importuned me in a)Tj
T*(whisper to give her directly what I had brought.  Heathcliff guessed the)Tj
T*(meaning of her manoeuvres, and said--'If you have got anything for)Tj
T*(Isabella \(as no doubt you have, Nelly\), give it to her.  You needn't make)Tj
T*(a secret of it: we have no secrets between us.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at)Tj
T*(once.  'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either)Tj
T*(a letter or a visit from him at present.  He sends his love, ma'am, and)Tj
T*(his wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have)Tj
T*(occasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the)Tj
T*(household here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of)Tj
T*(keeping it up.')Tj

T*(Mrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in)Tj
T*(the window.  Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and)Tj

T*(began to put questions concerning Catherine.  I told him as much as I)Tj
T*(thought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by)Tj
T*(cross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  I blamed)Tj
T*(her, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping)Tj
T*(that he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference)Tj
T*(with his family, for good or evil.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said; 'she'll never be like she)Tj
T*(was, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,)Tj
T*(you'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country)Tj
T*(entirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine)Tj
T*(Linton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as)Tj
T*(that young lady is different from me.  Her appearance is changed greatly,)Tj
T*(her character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of)Tj
T*(necessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter)Tj
T*(by the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense)Tj
T*(of duty!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem)Tj
T*(calm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common)Tj
T*(humanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.  But do you imagine that)Tj
T*(I shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare)Tj
T*(my feelings respecting Catherine to his?  Before you leave this house, I)Tj
T*(must exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her:)Tj
T*(consent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!  What do you say?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall,)Tj
T*(through my means.  Another encounter between you and the master would)Tj
T*(kill her altogether.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be)Tj
T*(danger of such an event--should he be the cause of adding a single)Tj
T*(trouble more to her existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going)Tj
T*(to extremes!  I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether)Tj
T*(Catherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would)Tj
T*(restrains me.  And there you see the distinction between our feelings:)Tj
T*(had he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred)Tj
T*(that turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against)Tj
T*(him.  You may look incredulous, if you please!  I never would have)Tj
T*(banished him from her society as long as she desired his.  The moment her)Tj
T*(regard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!  But,)Tj
T*(till then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would)Tj
T*(have died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all)Tj
T*(hopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her)Tj
T*(remembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in)Tj
T*(a new tumult of discord and distress.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'Oh, Nelly! you know)Tj
T*(she has not!  You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends)Tj
T*(on Linton she spends a thousand on me!  At a most miserable period of my)Tj
T*(life, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the)Tj
T*(neighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit)Tj
T*(the horrible idea again.  And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,)Tj
T*(nor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.  Two words would comprehend my)Tj
T*(future--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.)Tj
T*(Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's)Tj

T*(brach to dream that I could love her?  Tell your master, Nelly, that I)Tj
T*(never, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  She even)Tj

T*(law.  I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right)Tj
T*(to claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing)Tj

T*(entering.  If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him)Tj

T*(servants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.  But)Tj
T*(wouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their)Tj

T*(then you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house:)Tj
T*(and, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs.)Tj
T*(Linton's tranquillity for his satisfaction.  'The commonest occurrence)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed)Tj
T*(Heathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow)Tj
T*(morning.  It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear)Tj
T*(to see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare)Tj
T*(her--ask her if I may come.  You say she never mentions my name, and that)Tj
T*(I am never mentioned to her.  To whom should she mention me if I am a)Tj
T*(forbidden topic in the house?  She thinks you are all spies for her)Tj
T*(husband.  Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you!  I guess by her)Tj
T*(silence, as much as anything, what she feels.  You say she is often)Tj
T*(restless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?  You talk)Tj
T*(of her mind being unsettled.  How the devil could it be otherwise in her)Tj
T*(frightful isolation?  And that insipid, paltry creature attending her)Tj
T*(from _duty_ and _humanity_!  From _pity_ and _charity_!  He might as well)Tj
T*(plant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can)Tj
T*(restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?  Let us settle it)Tj
T*(at once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over)Tj
T*(Linton and his footman?  Or will you be my friend, as you have been)Tj
T*(hitherto, and do what I request?  Decide! because there is no reason for)Tj
T*(my lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Well, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty)Tj
T*(times; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  I engaged to)Tj
T*(carry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I)Tj
T*(promised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,)Tj
T*(when he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and)Tj
T*(my fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  Was it right or)Tj

T*(another explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a)Tj

T*(all disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,)Tj
T*(that that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,)Tj

T*(In the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,)Tj

T*(shunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and)Tj
T*(didn't want to be threatened or teased any more.  I had made up my mind)Tj
T*(not to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how)Tj
T*(its receipt would affect Catherine.  The consequence was, that it did not)Tj
T*(reach her before the lapse of three days.  The fourth was Sunday, and I)Tj
T*(brought it into her room after the family were gone to church.  There was)Tj
T*(a manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a)Tj
T*(practice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that)Tj
T*(occasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,)Tj
T*(and, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my)Tj
T*(companion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he)Tj

T*(He departed, and I went up-stairs.)Tj

T*(Mrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her)Tj
T*(shoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  Her thick, long)Tj
T*(hair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she)Tj
T*(wore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.)Tj
T*(Her appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was)Tj
T*(calm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  The flash of her eyes)Tj
T*(had been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer)Tj
T*(gave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared)Tj
T*(always to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this)Tj
T*(world.  Then, the paleness of her face--its haggard aspect having)Tj

T*(the touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,)Tj

T*(Gimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of)Tj
T*(the beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.  It was a sweet)Tj
T*(substitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned)Tj
T*(that music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.  At Wuthering)Tj
T*(Heights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a)Tj

T*('There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in)Tj
T*(one hand that rested on her knee.  'You must read it immediately, because)Tj

T*(without altering the direction of her eyes.  I opened it--it was very)Tj
T*(short.  'Now,' I continued, 'read it.'  She drew away her hand, and let)Tj
T*(it fall.  I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should)Tj
T*(please her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at)Tj
T*(last I resumed--'Must I read it, ma'am?  It is from Mr. Heathcliff.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(There was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to)Tj
T*(arrange her ideas.  She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and)Tj
T*(when she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not)Tj
T*(gathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely)Tj
T*(pointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning)Tj
T*(eagerness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an)Tj
T*(interpreter.  'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know)Tj

T*(As I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise)Tj
T*(its ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by)Tj
T*(a wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Ere long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards)Tj

T*(that breathed as soft as summer.)Tj
T*()Tj

T*(asleep.  I won't stray five yards from your window.')Tj
T*()Tj

T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(About twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at)Tj
T*(Wuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the)Tj
T*(mother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, or know Edgar.  The latter's distraction at his bereavement)Tj
T*(is a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how)Tj
T*(deep the sorrow sunk.  A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left)Tj
T*(without an heir.  I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I)Tj
T*(mentally abused old Linton for \(what was only natural partiality\) the)Tj
T*(securing his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.  An)Tj
T*(unwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!  It might have wailed out of life,)Tj
T*(and nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.  We)Tj
T*(redeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as)Tj
T*(its end is likely to be.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Next morning--bright and cheerful out of doors--stole softened in through)Tj
T*(the blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant)Tj
T*(with a mellow, tender glow.  Edgar Linton had his head laid on the)Tj
T*(pillow, and his eyes shut.  His young and fair features were almost as)Tj

T*(of the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier)Tj
T*(frame than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.  I)Tj

T*('Incomparably beyond and above us all!  Whether still on earth or now in)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than)Tj
T*(happy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or)Tj
T*(despairing mourner share the duty with me.  I see a repose that neither)Tj
T*(earth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and)Tj
T*(shadowless hereafter--the Eternity they have entered--where life is)Tj
T*(boundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its)Tj
T*(fulness.  I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even)Tj
T*(in a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed)Tj
T*(release!  To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and)Tj
T*(impatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at)Tj
T*(last.  One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in)Tj
T*(the presence of her corpse.  It asserted its own tranquillity, which)Tj
T*(seemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(The master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the)Tj
T*(room and steal out to the pure refreshing air.  The servants thought me)Tj
T*(gone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my)Tj
T*(chief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.  If he had remained among the)Tj
T*(larches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange;)Tj
T*(unless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to)Tj
T*(Gimmerton.  If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the)Tj
T*(lights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer)Tj
T*(doors, that all was not right within.  I wished, yet feared, to find him.)Tj
T*(I felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but)Tj
T*(how to do it I did not know.  He was there--at least, a few yards further)Tj
T*(in the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair)Tj
T*(soaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell)Tj
T*(pattering round him.  He had been standing a long time in that position,)Tj
T*(for I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from)Tj
T*(him, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more)Tj
T*(than that of a piece of timber.  They flew off at my approach, and he)Tj
T*(raised his eyes and spoke:--'She's dead!' he said; 'I've not waited for)Tj
T*(you to learn that.  Put your handkerchief away--don't snivel before me.)Tj
T*(Damn you all! she wants none of your tears!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that)Tj
T*(have none of the feeling either for themselves or others.  When I first)Tj
T*(looked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the)Tj
T*(catastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled)Tj
T*(and he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the)Tj
T*(ground.)Tj

T*(where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.  Grief, and that)Tj
T*(together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office)Tj
T*(of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all)Tj
T*(occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his)Tj
T*(park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and)Tj
T*(visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning)Tj
T*(before other wanderers were abroad.  But he was too good to be thoroughly)Tj
T*(unhappy long.  _He_ didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him.  Time)Tj
T*(brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.  He)Tj
T*(recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the)Tj
T*(better world; where he doubted not she was gone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(And he had earthly consolation and affections also.  For a few days, I)Tj
T*(said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that)Tj
T*(coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could)Tj
T*(stammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his)Tj
T*(heart.  It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,)Tj
T*(as he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because)Tj
T*(Heathcliff had a habit of doing so.  The little one was always Cathy: it)Tj
T*(formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with)Tj
T*(her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than)Tj
T*(from its being his own.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex)Tj
T*(myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in)Tj
T*(similar circumstances.  They had both been fond husbands, and were both)Tj
T*(attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both)Tj
T*(have taken the same road, for good or evil.  But, I thought in my mind,)Tj
T*(Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the)Tj
T*(worse and the weaker man.  When his ship struck, the captain abandoned)Tj
T*(his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot)Tj
T*(and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.  Linton, on the)Tj
T*(contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he)Tj
T*(trusted God; and God comforted him.  One hoped, and the other despaired:)Tj
T*(they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.)Tj
T*(But you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as)Tj
T*(well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and)Tj
T*(that's the same.  The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected;)Tj
T*(it followed fast on his sister's: there were scarcely six months between)Tj
T*(them.  We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state)Tj
T*(preceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the)Tj
T*(preparations for the funeral.  Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to)Tj
T*(my master.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not)Tj
T*(to alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, 'it's yours and my)Tj
T*(turn to go into mourning at present.  Who's given us the slip now, do you)Tj
T*(think?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Who?' I asked in a flurry.)Tj

T*(need it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed.)Tj

T*('What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor.  'No, Heathcliff's)Tj

T*('Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Hindley Earnshaw!  Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, 'and my wicked)Tj
T*(gossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while.  There!  I said)Tj
T*(we should draw water.  But cheer up!  He died true to his character:)Tj
T*(drunk as a lord.  Poor lad!  I'm sorry, too.  One can't help missing an)Tj

T*(imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.  He's barely)Tj
T*(twenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you)Tj
T*(were born in one year?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's)Tj
T*(death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the)Tj
T*(porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get)Tj
T*(another servant to introduce him to the master.  I could not hinder)Tj
T*(myself from pondering on the question--'Had he had fair play?'  Whatever)Tj
T*(I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that)Tj
T*(I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in)Tj
T*(the last duties to the dead.  Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to)Tj
T*(consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which)Tj
T*(he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my)Tj
T*(services as strong as his own.  Besides, I reminded him that the child)Tj
T*(Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he)Tj
T*(ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the)Tj
T*(property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law.  He)Tj
T*(was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his)Tj
T*(lawyer; and at length permitted me to go.  His lawyer had been Earnshaw's)Tj
T*(also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me.  He shook)Tj
T*(his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if)Tj
T*(the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('His father died in debt,' he said; 'the whole property is mortgaged, and)Tj
T*(the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of)Tj
T*(creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined)Tj
T*(to deal leniently towards him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything)Tj
T*(carried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress,)Tj
T*(expressed satisfaction at my presence.  Mr. Heathcliff said he did not)Tj
T*(perceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements)Tj
T*(for the funeral, if I chose.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Correctly,' he remarked, 'that fool's body should he buried at the cross-)Tj
T*(roads, without ceremony of any kind.  I happened to leave him ten minutes)Tj
T*(yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two doors of)Tj
T*(the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking himself to)Tj
T*(death deliberately!  We broke in this morning, for we heard him sporting)Tj
T*(like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle: flaying and)Tj
T*(scalping would not have wakened him.  I sent for Kenneth, and he came;)Tj
T*(but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both dead and)Tj
T*(cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more stir)Tj
T*(about him!')Tj

T*(I insisted on the funeral being respectable.  Mr. Heathcliff said I might)Tj
T*(have my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money)Tj
T*(for the whole affair came out of his pocket.  He maintained a hard,)Tj
T*(careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything,)Tj
T*(it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work)Tj
T*(successfully executed.  I observed once, indeed, something like)Tj
T*(exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the)Tj
T*(coffin from the house.  He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and)Tj
T*(previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to)Tj
T*(the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'Now, my bonny lad, you are)Tj
T*(_mine_!  And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with)Tj
T*(the same wind to twist it!'  The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this)Tj
T*(speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but)Tj
T*(I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'That boy must go back with)Tj
T*(me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.  There is nothing in the world less yours)Tj
T*(than he is!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Does Linton say so?' he demanded.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Of course--he has ordered me to take him,' I replied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but I have)Tj
T*(a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master)Tj
T*(that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove)Tj
T*(it.  I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure)Tj
T*(to make the other come!  Remember to tell him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This hint was enough to bind our hands.  I repeated its substance on my)Tj
T*(return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no)Tj
T*(more of interfering.  I'm not aware that he could have done it to any)Tj
T*(purpose, had he been ever so willing.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm)Tj
T*(possession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved it to)Tj
T*(Mr. Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for)Tj
T*(cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the)Tj
T*(mortgagee.  In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman)Tj
T*(in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on)Tj
T*(his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant,)Tj
T*(deprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,)Tj

T*(intense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble)Tj
T*(her: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice)Tj
T*(and pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never)Tj
T*(fierce: it was deep and tender.  However, it must be acknowledged, she)Tj
T*(had faults to foil her gifts.  A propensity to be saucy was one; and a)Tj
T*(perverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be)Tj
T*(good tempered or cross.  If a servant chanced to vex her, it was)Tj
T*(always--'I shall tell papa!'  And if he reproved her, even by a look, you)Tj
T*(would have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he ever)Tj
T*(did speak a harsh word to her.  He took her education entirely on)Tj
T*(himself, and made it an amusement.  Fortunately, curiosity and a quick)Tj
T*(intellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and)Tj
T*(did honour to his teaching.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Till she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the)Tj
T*(range of the park by herself.  Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile)Tj
T*(or so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.)Tj
T*(Gimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only)Tj
T*(building she had approached or entered, except her own home.  Wuthering)Tj
T*(Heights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect)Tj
T*(recluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.  Sometimes, indeed, while)Tj
T*(surveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe--)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?)Tj
T*(I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?')Tj

T*('No, Miss Cathy,' I would answer; 'it is hills again, just like these.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?' she)Tj
T*(once asked.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice;)Tj
T*(especially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and)Tj
T*(the whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.  I explained that)Tj
T*(they were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts)Tj
T*(to nourish a stunted tree.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?' she pursued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,' replied I; 'you)Tj
T*(could not climb them, they are too high and steep.  In winter the frost)Tj
T*(is always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found)Tj
T*(snow under that black hollow on the north-east side!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, you have been on them!' she cried gleefully.  'Then I can go, too,)Tj
T*(when I am a woman.  Has papa been, Ellen?')Tj

T*('Papa would tell you, Miss,' I answered, hastily, 'that they are not)Tj
T*(worth the trouble of visiting.  The moors, where you ramble with him, are)Tj
T*(much nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.')Tj

T*('But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself.)Tj

T*(yet.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her)Tj
T*(husband.  Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both)Tj
T*(lacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.  What)Tj
T*(her last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the)Tj
T*(same thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and)Tj
T*(rapidly consuming life towards the close.  She wrote to inform her)Tj
T*(brother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under)Tj
T*(which she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible;)Tj
T*(for she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver)Tj
T*(Linton safely into his hands.  Her hope was that Linton might be left)Tj
T*(with him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince)Tj
T*(herself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or)Tj
T*(education.  My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her)Tj
T*(request: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to)Tj
T*(answer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his)Tj
T*(absence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park,)Tj
T*(even under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He was away three weeks.  The first day or two my charge sat in a corner)Tj
T*(of the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet)Tj
T*(state she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval)Tj
T*(of impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to)Tj
T*(run up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might)Tj
T*(entertain herself.  I used to send her on her travels round the)Tj
T*(grounds--now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient)Tj
T*(audience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this)Tj
T*(solitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast)Tj
T*(till tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful)Tj
T*(tales.  I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were)Tj
T*(generally looked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,)Tj
T*(if they had stood wide open.  Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.)Tj
T*(Catherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she was)Tj
T*(that day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan;)Tj
T*(and I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse,)Tj
T*(and three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.  I)Tj
T*(got together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one)Tj
T*(side of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her)Tj
T*(wide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a)Tj
T*(merry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come)Tj
T*(back early.  The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.  One)Tj
T*(traveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned;)Tj
T*(but neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any)Tj
T*(direction: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at)Tj
T*(last went wandering in search of her myself.  There was a labourer)Tj

T*(Hareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too)Tj
T*(awkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How long am I to wait?' I continued, disregarding the woman's)Tj
T*(interference.  'It will be dark in ten minutes.  Where is the pony, Miss)Tj
T*(Cathy?  And where is Phoenix?  I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so)Tj
T*(please yourself.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('The pony is in the yard,' she replied, 'and Phoenix is shut in there.)Tj
T*(He's bitten--and so is Charlie.  I was going to tell you all about it;)Tj
T*(but you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that)Tj
T*(the people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the)Tj
T*(room; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind)Tj
T*(the furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.  Hareton and the)Tj
T*(woman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;)Tj
T*(till I cried, in great irritation,--'Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware)Tj
T*(whose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It's _your_ father's, isn't it?' said she, turning to Hareton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nay,' he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his)Tj
T*(own.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Whose then--your master's?' she asked.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and)Tj
T*(turned away.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Who is his master?' continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.  'He)Tj
T*(talked about "our house," and "our folk."  I thought he had been the)Tj
T*(owner's son.  And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn't he,)Tj
T*(if he's a servant?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Hareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.  I)Tj
T*(silently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for)Tj
T*(departure.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Now, get my horse,' she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she)Tj
T*(would one of the stable-boys at the Grange.  'And you may come with me.  I)Tj
T*(want to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about)Tj
T*(the _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!  What's the matter?)Tj
T*(Get my horse, I say.')Tj

T*(Hareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her)Tj
T*(eyes with indignation.  'You bring the pony,' she exclaimed, turning to)Tj
T*(the woman, 'and let my dog free this moment!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Softly, Miss,' answered she addressed: 'you'll lose nothing by being)Tj
T*(civil.  Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he's your)Tj
T*(cousin: and I was never hired to serve you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('_He_ my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, indeed,' responded her reprover.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,' she pursued in great)Tj
T*(trouble.  'Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a)Tj
T*(gentleman's son.  That my--' she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the)Tj
T*(bare notion of relationship with such a clown.)Tj

T*(keep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He's not--he's not my cousin, Ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief)Tj
T*(from reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the)Tj
T*(idea.)Tj

T*(I was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;)Tj
T*(having no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the)Tj
T*(former, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that)Tj
T*(Catherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an)Tj
T*(explanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.)Tj
T*(Hareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed)Tj
T*(moved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he)Tj
T*(took, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the)Tj
T*(kennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought.)Tj
T*(Pausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and)Tj
T*(horror, then burst forth anew.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor)Tj
T*(fellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,)Tj
T*(and stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily)Tj
T*(occupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after)Tj
T*(rabbits and game.  Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a)Tj
T*(mind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.  Good things)Tj
T*(lost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far)Tj
T*(over-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a)Tj

T*(circumstances.  Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically)Tj
T*(ill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that)Tj
T*(course of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would)Tj
T*(have given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment.  He appeared)Tj
T*(to have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught)Tj
T*(to read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his)Tj
T*(keeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single)Tj
T*(precept against vice.  And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to)Tj
T*(his deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to)Tj
T*(flatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family.)Tj

T*(ways,' so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the)Tj
T*(shoulders of the usurper of his property.  If the lad swore, he wouldn't)Tj
T*(correct him: nor however culpably he behaved.  It gave Joseph)Tj
T*(satisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed)Tj
T*(that the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but)Tj
T*(then he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it.  Hareton's blood)Tj
T*(would be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that)Tj
T*(thought.  Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his)Tj
T*(lineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the)Tj
T*(present owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to)Tj
T*(superstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered)Tj
T*(innuendoes and private comminations.  I don't pretend to be intimately)Tj
T*(acquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering)Tj
T*(Heights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little.  The villagers)Tj
T*(affirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his)Tj
T*(tenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of)Tj
T*(comfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in)Tj
T*(Hindley's time were not now enacted within its walls.  The master was too)Tj
T*(gloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(This, however, is not making progress with my story.  Miss Cathy rejected)Tj
T*(the peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and)Tj
T*(Phoenix.  They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for)Tj
T*(home, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.  I could not wring from my)Tj
T*(little lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the)Tj
T*(goal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without)Tj
T*(adventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue)Tj
T*(forth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train.  They)Tj
T*(had a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed)Tj
T*(an introduction.  Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was)Tj
T*(going; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to)Tj
T*(accompany her.  He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty)Tj
T*(other queer places.  But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a)Tj
T*(description of the interesting objects she saw.  I could gather, however,)Tj
T*(that her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by)Tj
T*(addressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by)Tj
T*(calling him her cousin.  Then the language he had held to her rankled in)Tj
T*(her heart; she who was always 'love,' and 'darling,' and 'queen,' and)Tj
T*('angel,' with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a)Tj
T*(stranger!  She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a)Tj
T*(promise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.  I)Tj
T*(explained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how)Tj
T*(sorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the)Tj
T*(fact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps)Tj
T*(be so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that)Tj
T*(prospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.  After all, she)Tj

T*(early morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now)Tj
T*(attired in her new black frock--poor thing! her aunt's death impressed)Tj
T*(her with no definite sorrow--she obliged me, by constant worrying, to)Tj
T*(walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as we)Tj
T*(strolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under)Tj
T*(shadow of the trees.  'How delightful it will be to have him for a)Tj
T*(playfellow!  Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was)Tj
T*(lighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine.  I have it carefully)Tj
T*(preserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure)Tj
T*(it would be to see its owner.  Oh! I am happy--and papa, dear, dear papa!)Tj
T*(Come, Ellen, let us run! come, run.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps)Tj
T*(reached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside)Tj
T*(the path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she)Tj
T*(couldn't be still a minute.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How long they are!' she exclaimed.  'Ah, I see, some dust on the)Tj
T*(road--they are coming!  No!  When will they be here?  May we not go a)Tj
T*(little way--half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?  Do say Yes: to)Tj
T*(that clump of birches at the turn!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I refused staunchly.  At length her suspense was ended: the travelling)Tj
T*(carriage rolled in sight.  Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms)Tj
T*(as soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window.  He)Tj
T*(descended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval)Tj
T*(elapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.  While)Tj
T*(they exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.  He was)Tj
T*(asleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been)Tj
T*(winter.  A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for)Tj
T*(my master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was)Tj
T*(a sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.  The)Tj
T*(latter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the)Tj
T*(door, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.  Cathy)Tj
T*(would fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and)Tj
T*(they walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the)Tj
T*(servants.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Now, darling,' said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted)Tj
T*(at the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so)Tj
T*(merry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time)Tj
T*(since; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you)Tj
T*(directly.  And don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this)Tj
T*(evening, at least, will you?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: 'but I do want to see him; and he)Tj
T*(hasn't once looked out.')Tj

T*(The carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the)Tj
T*(ground by his uncle.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little hands)Tj
T*(together.  'She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by)Tj
T*(crying to-night.  Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,)Tj
T*(and you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's)Tj
T*(salute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears.)Tj

T*(make her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad)Tj
T*(a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.  All three entered,)Tj
T*(and mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.  I proceeded to)Tj
T*(remove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;)Tj
T*(but he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.  My master)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(He had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his)Tj

T*(Cathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.  At first she sat)Tj
T*(silent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her)Tj
T*(little cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking)Tj
T*(his curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,)Tj
T*(like a baby.  This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his)Tj
T*(eyes, and lightened into a faint smile.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching them a)Tj
T*(minute.  'Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.  The company of a child)Tj
T*(of his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for)Tj
T*(strength he'll gain it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came)Tj
T*(over me that there was slight hope of that.  And then, I thought, how)Tj
T*(ever will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?  Between his father)Tj
T*(and Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be.  Our doubts were)Tj
T*(presently decided--even earlier than I expected.  I had just taken the)Tj
T*(children up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep--he)Tj
T*(would not suffer me to leave him till that was the case--I had come down,)Tj
T*(and was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for)Tj
T*(Mr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with)Tj
T*(the master.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable)Tj
T*(trepidation.  'A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the)Tj

T*('It is not so buried in trees,' I replied, 'and it is not quite so large,)Tj

T*(the moors.  Hareton Earnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so)Tj
T*(yours in a manner--will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can)Tj
T*(bring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,)Tj
T*(now and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,)Tj
T*(walk out on the hills.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And what is my father like?' he asked.  'Is he as young and handsome as)Tj
T*(uncle?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He's as young,' said I; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks)Tj
T*(sterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  He'll not seem to you)Tj
T*(so gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,)Tj
T*(mind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of)Tj
T*(you than any uncle, for you are his own.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Black hair and eyes!' mused Linton.  'I can't fancy him.  Then I am not)Tj
T*(like him, am I?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Not much,' I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret)Tj
T*(the white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large)Tj
T*(languid eyes--his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness)Tj
T*(kindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured.)Tj
T*('Has he ever seen me?  If he has, I must have been a baby.  I remember)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Why, Master Linton,' said I, 'three hundred miles is a great distance;)Tj
T*(and ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared)Tj
T*(with what they do to you.  It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going)Tj
T*(from summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now)Tj
T*(it is too late.  Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will)Tj
T*(disturb him, for no good.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of)Tj
T*(the ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.  I watched to)Tj
T*(catch his impressions in his countenance.  He surveyed the carved front)Tj
T*(and low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked)Tj
T*(firs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private)Tj
T*(feelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.  But he)Tj
T*(had sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.)Tj
T*(Before he dismounted, I went and opened the door.  It was half-past six;)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(He took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt)Tj
T*(his slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton)Tj
T*(ceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.)Tj

T*('Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the)Tj
T*(limbs were all equally frail and feeble.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You've heard of me, I daresay?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' he replied again.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No!  What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for)Tj

T*(slut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.  Now,)Tj
T*(don't wince, and colour up!  Though it is something to see you have not)Tj
T*(white blood.  Be a good lad; and I'll do for you.  Nelly, if you be tired)Tj
T*(you may sit down; if not, get home again.  I guess you'll report what you)Tj

T*('Well,' replied I, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or)Tj

T*('I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing.  'Only)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(While he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,)Tj

T*(compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff)Tj
T*(plainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions)Tj
T*(to prepare some.  Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may)Tj

T*(We had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager)Tj
T*(to join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed)Tj
T*(the news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her,)Tj
T*(by affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if I can get)Tj
T*(him'; and there were no hopes of that.  This promise poorly pacified her;)Tj
T*(but time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of)Tj
T*(her father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his)Tj
T*(features had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(When I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in)Tj
T*(paying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master)Tj
T*(got on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was)Tj
T*(never to be seen.  I could gather from her that he continued in weak)Tj
T*(health, and was a tiresome inmate.  She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to)Tj
T*(dislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal)Tj
T*(it: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at)Tj
T*(all with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.)Tj
T*(There seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and)Tj
T*(spent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else)Tj
T*(lay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and)Tj
T*(aches, and pains of some sort.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And I never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor)Tj
T*(one so careful of hisseln.  He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a)Tj
T*(bit late in the evening.  Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air!  And)Tj
T*(he must have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is)Tj
T*(poison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,)Tj
T*(milk for ever--heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;)Tj
T*(and there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the)Tj
T*(fire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and)Tj
T*(if Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him--Hareton is not bad-natured,)Tj
T*(though he's rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other)Tj
T*(crying.  I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a)Tj
T*(mummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn)Tj
T*(him out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln.  But then)Tj
T*(he won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and)Tj
T*(should Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him up-)Tj
T*(stairs directly.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered)Tj
T*(young Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally;)Tj
T*(and my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved)Tj
T*(with a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with)Tj
T*(us.  Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal)Tj
T*(about him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told)Tj
T*(me once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?  She)Tj
T*(said he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and)Tj
T*(both times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days)Tj
T*(afterwards.  That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years)Tj
T*(after he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she)Tj
T*(lives there still.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Time wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy)Tj
T*(reached sixteen.  On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any)Tj
T*(signs of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late)Tj
T*(mistress's death.  Her father invariably spent that day alone in the)Tj
T*(library; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he)Tj
T*(would frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.  Therefore Catherine)Tj
T*(was thrown on her own resources for amusement.  This twentieth of March)Tj

T*(was a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young)Tj
T*(lady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble)Tj
T*(on the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we)Tj
T*(went only a short distance and were back within the hour.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('So make haste, Ellen!' she cried.  'I know where I wish to go; where a)Tj
T*(colony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made)Tj
T*(their nests yet.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That must be a good distance up,' I answered; 'they don't breed on the)Tj
T*(edge of the moor.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, it's not,' she said.  'I've gone very near with papa.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.)Tj
T*(She bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a)Tj
T*(young greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in)Tj
T*(listening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm)Tj
T*(sunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden)Tj
T*(ringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in)Tj
T*(its bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.)Tj
T*(She was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.  It's a pity she)Tj
T*(could not be content.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well,' said I, 'where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?  We should be at)Tj
T*(them: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, a little further--only a little further, Ellen,' was her answer,)Tj
T*(continually.  'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you)Tj
T*(reach the other side I shall have raised the birds.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at)Tj
T*(length, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our)Tj
T*(steps.  I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she)Tj
T*(either did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was)Tj
T*(compelled to follow.  Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came)Tj
T*(in sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than)Tj
T*(her own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I)Tj
T*(felt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting)Tj
T*(out the nests of the grouse.  The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he)Tj
T*(was reproving the poacher.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as I toiled to them,)Tj
T*(expanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.  'I didn't mean to)Tj
T*(take them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished)Tj
T*(to see the eggs.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his)Tj
T*(acquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards)Tj
T*(it, and demanded who 'papa' was?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied.  'I thought you did not)Tj
T*(know me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.')Tj
T*()Tj

T*(Think!  Ah! you have a short memory.  Linton, don't you recall your)Tj
T*(cousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What, Linton!' cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.)Tj
T*('Is that little Linton?  He's taller than I am!  Are you Linton?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him)Tj
T*(fervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in)Tj
T*(the appearance of each.  Catherine had reached her full height; her)Tj
T*(figure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect)Tj
T*(sparkling with health and spirits.  Linton's looks and movements were)Tj
T*(very languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his)Tj
T*(manner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.)Tj
T*(After exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between)Tj
T*(the objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to)Tj
T*(observe the latter, and really noting the former alone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him.  'I)Tj
T*(thought I liked you, though you were cross at first.  Why don't you visit)Tj
T*(at the Grange with Linton?  To live all these years such close)Tj
T*(neighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered.)Tj
T*('There--damn it!  If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton:)Tj
T*(they are thrown away on me.')Tj

T*('Naughty Ellen!' exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her)Tj
T*(lavish caresses.  'Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.  But)Tj
T*(I'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes)Tj
T*(bring papa.  Won't you be glad to see us?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,)Tj
T*(resulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.  'But)Tj
T*(stay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady.  'Now I think of it,)Tj
T*(I'd better tell you.  Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we)Tj
T*(quarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if)Tj
T*(you mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Why did you quarrel?' asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was)Tj
T*(grieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.  But)Tj

T*('It will be too far for me,' murmured her cousin: 'to walk four miles)Tj
T*(would kill me.  No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every)Tj
T*(morning, but once or twice a week.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.)Tj

T*('I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,' he muttered to me.  'Miss)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Yes, father,' answered the boy.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit)Tj
T*(or a weasel's nest?  Take her into the garden, before you change your)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone)Tj
T*(which expressed reluctance to move again.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and)Tj
T*(evidently eager to be active.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.  Heathcliff rose, and)Tj
T*(went into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for)Tj
T*(Hareton.  Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.  The young)Tj
T*(man had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks)Tj
T*(and his wetted hair.)Tj

T*(The uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in)Tj

T*(He watched the couple walking past the window.  Earnshaw had his)Tj
T*(countenance completely averted from his companion.  He seemed studying)Tj
T*(the familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest.)Tj
T*(Catherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.  She then)Tj
T*(turned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and)Tj
T*(tripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I've tied his tongue,' observed Heathcliff.  'He'll not venture a single)Tj

T*(it?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Worse,' I replied, 'because more sullen with it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud.  'He has)Tj
T*(satisfied my expectations.  If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it)Tj
T*(half so much.  But he's no fool; and I can sympathise with all his)Tj
T*(feelings, having felt them myself.  I know what he suffers now, for)Tj
T*(instance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,)Tj
T*(though.  And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness)Tj
T*(and ignorance.  I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father)Tj
T*(secured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness.  I've)Tj
T*(taught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak.  Don't you)Tj
T*(think Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as)Tj
T*(proud as I am of mine.  But there's this difference; one is gold put to)Tj
T*(the use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service)Tj
T*(of silver.  _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the)Tj
T*(merit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go.  _His_ had first-)Tj
T*(rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.  I)Tj
T*(have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware of.)Tj
T*(And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me!  You'll own that)Tj
T*(I've outmatched Hindley there.  If the dead villain could rise from his)Tj
T*(grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun of)Tj
T*(seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he should)Tj
T*(dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Heathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.  I made no reply,)Tj
T*(because I saw that he expected none.  Meantime, our young companion, who)Tj
T*(sat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms)Tj
T*(of uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of)Tj
T*(Catherine's society for fear of a little fatigue.  His father remarked)Tj
T*(the restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely)Tj
T*(extended towards his cap.)Tj

T*('Get up, you idle boy!' he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Linton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.  The lattice was open,)Tj

T*(attendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and)Tj

T*('Why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled Hareton, more ready in)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered Linton.  'Papa)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I)Tj

T*(conscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled)Tj
T*(when he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular)Tj

T*(And so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of)Tj

T*(still I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and)Tj

T*(She gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,' she answered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?' he)Tj

T*(you grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at)Tj

T*(might come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because)Tj
T*(you had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt)Tj
T*(Isabella.  And you won't.  _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing)Tj
T*(to let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(My master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her uncle-in-)Tj
T*(law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to Isabella,)Tj
T*(and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.  He could)Tj
T*(not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke little of)Tj
T*(it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his ancient enemy)Tj
T*(that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton's death.  'She might)Tj
T*(have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was his constant)Tj
T*(bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a murderer.  Miss)Tj
T*(Cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight acts of)Tj

T*(thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was)Tj

T*(for years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of)Tj
T*(remorse.  She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view)Tj
T*(of human nature--excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till)Tj

T*(desirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out)Tj
T*(beyond the leaves.  She also got a trick of coming down early in the)Tj
T*(morning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the)Tj
T*(arrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the)Tj
T*(library, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took)Tj
T*(special care to remove when she left it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and)Tj
T*(trinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of)Tj
T*(folded paper.  My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to)Tj
T*(take a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and)Tj
T*(my master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my)Tj
T*(house keys one that would fit the lock.  Having opened, I emptied the)Tj
T*(whole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure)Tj
T*(in my own chamber.  Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised)Tj
T*(to discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it)Tj
T*(must have been--from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by)Tj
T*(her.  The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,)Tj
T*(they expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the)Tj
T*(writer rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought)Tj
T*(were borrowed from a more experienced source.  Some of them struck me as)Tj
T*(singularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong)Tj
T*(feeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy)Tj
T*(might use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.  Whether they satisfied)Tj
T*(Cathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.  After)Tj
T*(turning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief)Tj
T*(and set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Following her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the)Tj
T*(kitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little)Tj
T*(boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into)Tj
T*(his jacket pocket, and plucked something out.  I went round by the)Tj
T*(garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend)Tj
T*(his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in)Tj
T*(abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did)Tj
T*(not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's)Tj
T*(affectionate composition.  It was more simple and more eloquent than her)Tj
T*(cousin's: very pretty and very silly.  I shook my head, and went)Tj
T*(meditating into the house.  The day being wet, she could not divert)Tj
T*(herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her)Tj
T*(morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.  Her father)Tj
T*(sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in)Tj
T*(some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily)Tj
T*(fixed on her proceedings.  Never did any bird flying back to a plundered)Tj
T*(nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more)Tj
T*(complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her)Tj
T*(single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.)Tj

T*(With a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.)Tj

T*('So,' I exclaimed, 'Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:)Tj

T*(She sprang at her precious epistles, but I hold them above my head; and)Tj

T*(anything rather than show them.  And being really fully as much inclined)Tj
T*(to laugh as scold--for I esteemed it all girlish vanity--I at length)Tj
T*(relented in a measure, and asked,--'If I consent to burn them, will you)Tj

T*(little boy came with vacant pockets.)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXII)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Summer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the)Tj
T*(harvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.)Tj
T*(Mr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;)Tj
T*(at the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the)Tj
T*(evening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that)Tj
T*(settled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the)Tj
T*(whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Poor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably)Tj
T*(sadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her)Tj
T*(reading less, and taking more exercise.  She had his companionship no)Tj
T*(longer; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,)Tj
T*(with mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three)Tj
T*(hours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and)Tj
T*(then my society was obviously less desirable than his.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh watery)Tj
T*(afternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered)Tj
T*(leaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark grey)Tj
T*(streamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain--I)Tj
T*(requested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of)Tj
T*(showers.  She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my)Tj
T*(umbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal)Tj
T*(walk which she generally affected if low-spirited--and that she)Tj
T*(invariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never)Tj
T*(known from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his)Tj
T*(increased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.  She went sadly)Tj
T*(on: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might)Tj
T*(well have tempted her to race.  And often, from the side of my eye, I)Tj
T*(could detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek.  I)Tj
T*(gazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.  On one side of the)Tj
T*(road rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their)Tj
T*(roots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the)Tj
T*(latter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.  In summer)Tj
T*(Miss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the)Tj
T*(branches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her)Tj
T*(agility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to)Tj
T*(scold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew)Tj
T*(there was no necessity for descending.  From dinner to tea she would lie)Tj
T*(in her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs--my)Tj
T*(nursery lore--to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and)Tj
T*(entice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half)Tj
T*(thinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.)Tj

T*('Look, Miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one)Tj
T*(twisted tree.  'Winter is not here yet.  There's a little flower up)Tj
T*(yonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those)Tj
T*(turf steps in July with a lilac mist.  Will you clamber up, and pluck it)Tj
T*(to show to papa?'  Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom)Tj
T*(trembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length--'No, I'll not)Tj
T*(touch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes,' I observed, 'about as starved and suckless as you your cheeks are)Tj
T*(bloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.  You're so low, I daresay I)Tj
T*(shall keep up with you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to)Tj
T*(muse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus)Tj
T*(spreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever)Tj
T*(and anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and putting)Tj
T*(my arm over her shoulder.  'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be)Tj
T*(thankful it is nothing worse.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by)Tj
T*(sobs.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Oh, it will be something worse,' she said.  'And what shall I do when)Tj
T*(papa and you leave me, and I am by myself?  I can't forget your words,)Tj
T*(Ellen; they are always in my ear.  How life will be changed, how dreary)Tj
T*(the world will be, when papa and you are dead.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('None can tell whether you won't die before us,' I replied.  'It's wrong)Tj
T*(to anticipate evil.  We'll hope there are years and years to come before)Tj
T*(any of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.  My)Tj
T*(mother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.  And suppose Mr.)Tj

T*(have counted, Miss.  And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity)Tj
T*(above twenty years beforehand?')Tj

T*('But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing up with)Tj
T*(timid hope to seek further consolation.)Tj

T*('Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied.  'She wasn't)Tj

T*(cheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!)Tj
T*(I'll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless,)Tj
T*(and cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who)Tj
T*(would be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that)Tj

T*('I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered my)Tj

T*(As we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young)Tj
T*(lady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on)Tj
T*(the top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed)Tj
T*(scarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the)Tj
T*(highway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch)Tj
T*(the upper, except from Cathy's present station.  In stretching to pull)Tj
T*(them, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed)Tj
T*(scrambling down to recover it.  I bid her be cautious lest she got a)Tj
T*(fall, and she nimbly disappeared.  But the return was no such easy)Tj
T*(matter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes)Tj
T*(and black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.  I,)Tj
T*(like a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her laughing and)Tj

T*(tried all the large keys in succession.  I had applied the last, and)Tj

T*(Vigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no)Tj

T*(perverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as)Tj
T*(grievous and harassing as it can.  I thoroughly gauged his disposition)Tj
T*(from his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt)Tj

T*(breath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.)Tj

T*(him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and)Tj
T*(couldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and)Tj
T*(then I negotiated with him about the pony.  He is fond of reading, and he)Tj

T*(charmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I)Tj

T*(me more, my pretty Linton will.  I trotted up their garden, and was)Tj
T*(turning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my)Tj
T*(bridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.  He patted Minny's neck,)Tj
T*(and said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak)Tj
T*(to him.  I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick)Tj
T*(him.  He answered in his vulgar accent, "It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it)Tj
T*(did;" and surveyed its legs with a smile.  I was half inclined to make it)Tj
T*(try; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch,)Tj
T*(he looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of)Tj
T*(awkwardness and elation: "Miss Catherine!  I can read yon, now.")Tj

T*('"Wonderful," I exclaimed.  "Pray let us hear you--you _are_ grown)Tj
T*(clever!")Tj

T*('She was,' continued the housekeeper.  'Her affection for him was still)Tj
T*(the chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in)Tj
T*(the deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and)Tj
T*(foes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could)Tj
T*(bequeath to guide her.  He said to me, a few days afterwards, "I wish my)Tj

T*(Spring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he)Tj

T*(sometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and)Tj

T*(That part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.  Heathcliff)Tj

T*(and let us exchange a few words, in your presence!  We have done nothing)Tj
T*(to deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no)Tj
T*(reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.  Dear uncle! send me a kind)Tj
T*(note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange.  I believe an interview would convince you that my)Tj
T*(father's character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his)Tj
T*(son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she)Tj
T*(has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.  You inquire after)Tj
T*(my health--it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and)Tj
T*(doomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will)Tj
T*(like me, how can I be cheerful and well?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Edgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his)Tj
T*(request; because he could not accompany Catherine.  He said, in summer,)Tj
T*(perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at)Tj
T*(intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by)Tj

T*(my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal)Tj
T*(sufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his)Tj
T*(thoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXVI)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Summer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his)Tj
T*(assent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride)Tj
T*(to join her cousin.  It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but)Tj
T*(with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of)Tj
T*(meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.  On)Tj
T*(arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,)Tj
T*(told us that,--'Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and)Tj
T*(he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' I)Tj
T*(observed: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at)Tj
T*(once.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my)Tj
T*(companion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from)Tj
T*(his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,)Tj
T*(and leave ours to graze.  He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and)Tj
T*(did not rise till we came within a few yards.  Then he walked so feebly,)Tj
T*(and looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,--'Why, Master)Tj
T*(Heathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.  How ill)Tj
T*(you do look!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the)Tj
T*(ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on)Tj
T*(their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse)Tj
T*(than usual?)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No--better--better!' he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if)Tj
T*(he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over)Tj
T*(her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the)Tj
T*(languid expression they once possessed.)Tj

T*('But you have been worse,' persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw)Tj
T*(you last; you are thinner, and--')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'm tired,' he interrupted, hurriedly.  'It is too hot for walking, let)Tj
T*(us rest here.  And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow)Tj
T*(so fast.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at)Tj
T*(cheerfulness.  'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the)Tj
T*(place and way each thought pleasantest?  This is nearly yours, only there)Tj
T*(are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than)Tj
T*(sunshine.  Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and)Tj
T*(try mine.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently)Tj
T*(great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.  His lack of)Tj
T*(interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to)Tj
T*(contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not)Tj
T*(conceal her disappointment.  An indefinite alteration had come over his)Tj
T*(whole person and manner.  The pettishness that might be caressed into)Tj
T*(fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish)Tj
T*(temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and)Tj
T*(more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling)Tj
T*(consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an)Tj
T*(insult.  Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a)Tj
T*(punishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no)Tj
T*(scruple of proposing, presently, to depart.  That proposal, unexpectedly,)Tj
T*(roused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of)Tj
T*(agitation.  He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would)Tj
T*(remain another half-hour, at least.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than)Tj
T*(sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and)Tj
T*(songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you)Tj
T*(have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you,)Tj
T*(I'd willingly stay.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Stay to rest yourself,' he replied.  'And, Catherine, don't think or say)Tj
T*(that I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me)Tj
T*(dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.  Tell)Tj
T*(uncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.  I couldn't affirm that you)Tj
T*(are,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of)Tj
T*(what was evidently an untruth.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('And be here again next Thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled)Tj
T*(gaze.  'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best)Tj
T*(thanks, Catherine.  And--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked)Tj
T*(you about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent)Tj
T*(and stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he'll be)Tj
T*(angry.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I care nothing for his anger,' exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be)Tj
T*(its object.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('But I do,' said her cousin, shuddering.  '_Don't_ provoke him against)Tj
T*(me, Catherine, for he is very hard.')Tj

T*('Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired.  'Has he grown)Tj
T*(weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by)Tj
T*(his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his)Tj
T*(breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or)Tj
T*(pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing)Tj
T*(the produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for)Tj
T*(she saw further notice would only weary and annoy.)Tj

T*('Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last.  'I)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Well, we must not leave him asleep,' I answered; 'wait till lie wakes,)Tj
T*(and be patient.  You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to)Tj
T*(see poor Linton has soon evaporated!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why did _he_ wish to see me?' returned Catherine.  'In his crossest)Tj
T*(humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious)Tj
T*(mood.  It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform--this)Tj
T*(interview--for fear his father should scold him.  But I'm hardly going to)Tj
T*(come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for)Tj
T*(ordering Linton to undergo this penance.  And, though I'm glad he's)Tj
T*(better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less)Tj
T*(affectionate to me.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You think _he is_ better in health, then?' I said.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes,' she answered; 'because he always made such a great deal of his)Tj
T*(sufferings, you know.  He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell)Tj
T*(papa; but he's better, very likely.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,' I remarked; 'I should conjecture)Tj
T*(him to be far worse.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if)Tj
T*(any one had called his name.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No,' said Catherine; 'unless in dreams.  I cannot conceive how you)Tj
T*(manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.')Tj

T*('I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab)Tj
T*(above us.  'You are sure nobody spoke?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Quite sure,' replied his cousin.  'Only Ellen and I were disputing)Tj
T*(concerning your health.  Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we)Tj

T*(stronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?')Tj

T*(The tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, 'Yes, yes, I am!')Tj

T*(Cathy rose.  'For to-day we must part,' she said.  'And I won't conceal)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXVII)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth)Tj
T*(rapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state.  The havoc that months had)Tj
T*(previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.  Catherine)Tj
T*(we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to)Tj
T*(delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful)Tj
T*(probability, gradually ripening into certainty.  She had not the heart to)Tj
T*(mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and)Tj
T*(obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her)Tj
T*(father stopped a short time daily--the brief period he could bear to sit)Tj
T*(up--and his chamber, had become her whole world.  She grudged each moment)Tj
T*(that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.  Her)Tj
T*(countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly)Tj
T*(dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of)Tj
T*(scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now)Tj
T*(be left entirely alone after his death.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that,)Tj
T*(as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for)Tj
T*(Linton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.)Tj
T*(And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error;)Tj
T*(asking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments)Tj
T*(with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to)Tj
T*(account.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of)Tj
T*(August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed)Tj
T*(whoever respired it, though dying, might revive.  Catherine's face was)Tj
T*(just like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid)Tj
T*(succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more)Tj
T*(transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that)Tj
T*(passing forgetfulness of its cares.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.  My)Tj
T*(young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a)Tj
T*(very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;)Tj

T*(but I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to)Tj

T*(Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the)Tj
T*(animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like)Tj
T*(fear.)Tj

T*('It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty.  'Is not your)Tj

T*('Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion.  'Foolish, silly boy!  And)Tj
T*(there! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him!  You needn't)Tj
T*(bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your)Tj
T*(service.  Get off!  I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from)Tj
T*(the hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend?  Let go my frock!)Tj
T*(If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should)Tj
T*(spurn such pity.  Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.  Rise,)Tj
T*(and don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don't_!')Tj

T*(With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his)Tj
T*(nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite)Tj
T*(terror.)Tj

T*('Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it!  Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor,)Tj

T*(strange talk, and I will.  You contradict your own words, and distract)Tj
T*(me!  Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your)Tj
T*(heart.  You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you?  You wouldn't let any)Tj

T*(she applied her teeth pretty sharply.  Heathcliff glanced at me a glance)Tj
T*(that kept me from interfering a moment.  Catherine was too intent on his)Tj
T*(fingers to notice his face.  He opened them suddenly, and resigned the)Tj
T*(object of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with)Tj
T*(the liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the)Tj
T*(other a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each)Tj
T*(sufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously.  'You villain!' I)Tj
T*(began to cry, 'you villain!'  A touch on the chest silenced me: I am)Tj
T*(stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I)Tj
T*(staggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a blood-)Tj
T*(vessel.  The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released, put her)Tj
T*(two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not sure whether)Tj
T*(her ears were off or on.  She trembled like a reed, poor thing, and leant)Tj
T*(against the table perfectly bewildered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly,)Tj
T*(as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the)Tj
T*(floor.  'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!  I shall)Tj
T*(be your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and)Tj
T*(you shall have plenty of that.  You can bear plenty; you're no weakling:)Tj
T*(you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your)Tj
T*(eyes again!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning)Tj
T*(cheek on my lap, weeping aloud.  Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of)Tj
T*(the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that)Tj
T*(the correction had alighted on another than him.  Mr. Heathcliff,)Tj
T*(perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea)Tj
T*(himself.  The cups and saucers were laid ready.  He poured it out, and)Tj

T*(Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.  We)Tj

T*(You're in no danger; but if you hinder me--Linton, I love papa better)Tj

T*(to the boy his coward's eloquence.  Catherine was near distraught: still,)Tj

T*(however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from)Tj

T*(down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously)Tj

T*(her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the)Tj
T*(picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has)Tj
T*(never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain.)Tj
T*(I don't like to think so; but she's a naughty thing for crying)Tj

T*(the Heights.  I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite)Tj
T*(true.  I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe)Tj
T*(all his father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no)Tj
T*(bitterness, if I could help it, to his already over-flowing cup.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal)Tj
T*(property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why)Tj
T*(he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because)Tj
T*(ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.)Tj
T*(However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving)Tj
T*(Catherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the)Tj
T*(hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she)Tj
T*(had any, after her.  By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff)Tj
T*(should Linton die.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and)Tj
T*(four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of)Tj
T*(her jailor.  Both parties were delayed very late.  The single servant)Tj
T*(returned first.  He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived)Tj
T*(at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then)Tj
T*(Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be)Tj
T*(done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.  The four men)Tj
T*(came back unaccompanied also.  They brought word that Catherine was ill:)Tj
T*(too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see)Tj
T*(her.  I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which)Tj
T*(I would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the)Tj
T*(Heights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were)Tj
T*(quietly surrendered to us.  Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and)Tj
T*(vowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to)Tj
T*(prevent it!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.  I had gone)Tj
T*(down-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing)Tj
T*(through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door)Tj
T*(made me jump.  'Oh! it is Green,' I said, recollecting myself--'only)Tj
T*(Green,' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but)Tj
T*(the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.  I put the jug)Tj
T*(on the banister and hastened to admit him myself.  The harvest moon shone)Tj
T*(clear outside.  It was not the attorney.  My own sweet little mistress)Tj
T*(sprang on my neck sobbing, 'Ellen, Ellen!  Is papa alive?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes,' I cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with)Tj
T*(us again!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room;)Tj
T*(but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and)Tj
T*(washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.  Then)Tj
T*(I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say,)Tj
T*(she should be happy with young Heathcliff.  She stared, but soon)Tj
T*(comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me)Tj
T*(she would not complain.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.  I stood outside the)Tj
T*(chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,)Tj
T*(then.  All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as)Tj
T*(her father's joy.  She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed)Tj
T*(on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.)Tj

T*(He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.  Kissing her cheek, he)Tj

T*(Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too)Tj
T*(weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she)Tj

T*(had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in)Tj
T*(obeying my master's summons.  Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the)Tj

T*(carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar)Tj
T*(Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his)Tj
T*(family.  There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud)Tj
T*(protestations against any infringement of its directions.  The funeral)Tj
T*(was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to)Tj
T*(stay at the Grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk)Tj
T*(of liberating her.  She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and)Tj
T*(she gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer.  It drove her desperate.)Tj
T*(Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left,)Tj
T*(was terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.  He)Tj
T*(had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and)Tj
T*(when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his)Tj
T*(petition was granted for once.  Catherine stole out before break of day.)Tj
T*(She dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she)Tj
T*(visited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily,)Tj
T*(lighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to)Tj

T*(library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen)Tj
T*(years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn)Tj
T*(landscape lay outside.  We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the)Tj
T*(apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid)Tj
T*(head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  Heathcliff)Tj
T*(advanced to the hearth.  Time had little altered his person either.  There)Tj
T*(was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his)Tj
T*(frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  Catherine)Tj
T*(had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'No more runnings away!  Where)Tj
T*(would you go?  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful)Tj
T*(daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.  I was)Tj
T*(embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business:)Tj
T*(he's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his)Tj
T*(look that he has received his due!  I brought him down one evening, the)Tj
T*(day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him)Tj
T*(afterwards.  I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.  In)Tj
T*(two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my)Tj
T*(presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me)Tj
T*(often, though I am not near.  Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the)Tj
T*(night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,)Tj
T*(whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your)Tj
T*(concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton)Tj
T*(to her?  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a)Tj
T*(daily plague to your unnatural heart.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my)Tj
T*(children about me, to be sure.  Besides, that lass owes me her services)Tj
T*(for her bread.  I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after)Tj
T*(Linton is gone.  Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to)Tj
T*(compel you.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I shall,' said Catherine.  'Linton is all I have to love in the world,)Tj
T*(and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me)Tj
T*(to him, you cannot make us hate each other.  And I defy you to hurt him)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you)Tj

T*(allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.)Tj

T*(you suppose I dread any change of that sort?  I expected such a)Tj
T*(transformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should)Tj
T*(not commence till I share it.  Besides, unless I had received a distinct)Tj

T*(another sigh, close at my ear.  I appeared to feel the warm breath of it)Tj
T*(displacing the sleet-laden wind.  I knew no living thing in flesh and)Tj
T*(blood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some)Tj
T*(substantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly)Tj
T*(I felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.  A sudden)Tj
T*(sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.  I relinquished)Tj
T*(my labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.)Tj
T*(Her presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and)Tj
T*(led me home.  You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her)Tj
T*(there.  I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.)Tj
T*(Having reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.  It was)Tj
T*(fastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my)Tj
T*(entrance.  I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then)Tj
T*(hurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers.  I looked round impatiently--I)Tj
T*(felt her by me--I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!  I ought)Tj
T*(to have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the)Tj
T*(fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  I had not one.  She)Tj
T*(showed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  And, since)Tj
T*(then, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that)Tj
T*(intolerable torture!  Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,)Tj
T*(if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the)Tj
T*(feebleness of Linton's.  When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed)Tj
T*(that on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should)Tj
T*(meet her coming in.  When I went from home I hastened to return; she)Tj
T*(_must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!  And when I slept in)Tj
T*(her chamber--I was beaten out of that.  I couldn't lie there; for the)Tj
T*(moment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding)Tj
T*(back the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head)Tj
T*(on the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to)Tj
T*(see.  And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be)Tj
T*(always disappointed!  It racked me!  I've often groaned aloud, till that)Tj
T*(old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the)Tj
T*(fiend inside of me.  Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified--a little.  It)Tj

T*(a painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.  He)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXXI)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.  I went to the Heights as I)Tj
T*(proposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to)Tj
T*(her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not)Tj
T*(conscious of anything odd in her request.  The front door stood open, but)Tj
T*(the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked)Tj
T*(Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.  The)Tj
T*(fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.  I took particular notice)Tj
T*(of him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least)Tj
T*(of his advantages.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?  He answered, No; but he would be)Tj
T*(in at dinner-time.  It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention)Tj
T*(of going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his)Tj
T*(tools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute)Tj
T*(for the host.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in)Tj
T*(preparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more sulky)Tj
T*(and less spirited than when I had seen her first.  She hardly raised her)Tj
T*(eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same disregard)Tj
T*(to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my bow and good-)Tj
T*(morning by the slightest acknowledgment.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade)Tj
T*(me to believe.  She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.  'Remove them)Tj
T*(yourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and)Tj
T*(retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of)Tj
T*(birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.  I approached her,)Tj
T*(pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly)Tj
T*(dropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she)Tj
T*(asked aloud, 'What is that?'  And chucked it off.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I)Tj

T*(should be imagined a missive of my own.  She would gladly have gathered)Tj

T*(a leaf.')Tj

T*('No books!' I exclaimed.  'How do you contrive to live here without them?)Tj
T*(if I may take the liberty to inquire.  Though provided with a large)Tj
T*(library, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and)Tj

T*(Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.)Tj
T*(I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.  Only once, I searched through)Tj
T*(Joseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I)Tj
T*(came upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some)Tj
T*(tales and poetry: all old friends.  I brought the last here--and you)Tj
T*(gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of)Tj

T*(The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at)Tj

T*(my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of)Tj

T*(Hareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe)Tj

T*(up my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.)Tj
T*(He followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,)Tj
T*(bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into)Tj
T*(Catherine's lap, exclaiming,--'Take them!  I never want to hear, or read,)Tj
T*(or think of them again!')Tj

T*('I won't have them now,' she answered.  'I shall connect them with you,)Tj
T*(and hate them.')Tj

T*(She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a)Tj

T*(But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not)Tj
T*(altogether disapprovingly, a manual cheek given to her saucy tongue.  The)Tj
T*(little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though)Tj

T*(of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.  He)Tj
T*(afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.  I read in his)Tj
T*(countenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.  I)Tj
T*(fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already)Tj
T*(imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated)Tj
T*(from them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies)Tj
T*(also.  He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,)Tj
T*(till Catherine crossed his path.  Shame at her scorn, and hope of her)Tj
T*(approval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of)Tj
T*(guarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to)Tj
T*(raise himself had produced just the contrary result.)Tj

T*(behind him.  'But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.  There was a)Tj
T*(restless, anxious expression in his countenance.  I had never remarked)Tj
T*(there before; and he looked sparer in person.  His daughter-in-law, on)Tj
T*(perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so)Tj
T*(that I remained alone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply)Tj
T*(to my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could)Tj
T*(readily supply your loss in this desolation.  I've wondered more than)Tj
T*(once what brought you here.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is)Tj
T*(going to spirit me away.  I shall set out for London next week; and I)Tj
T*(must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross)Tj
T*(Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.  I believe I shall)Tj

T*('Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he)Tj

T*(any one.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably)Tj
T*(irritated.  'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my)Tj
T*(note-book from my pocket.)Tj

T*('No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover)Tj
T*(your debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.  Sit down and)Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXXII)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in)Tj
T*(the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within)Tj
T*(fifteen miles of Gimmerton.  The ostler at a roadside public-house was)Tj
T*(holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green)Tj
T*(oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton,)Tj
T*(nah!  They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Gimmerton?' I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown)Tj
T*(dim and dreamy.  'Ah!  I know.  How far is it from this?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.  It was scarcely)Tj
T*(noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own)Tj
T*(roof as in an inn.  Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange)Tj
T*(matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading)Tj
T*(the neighbourhood again.  Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to)Tj
T*(inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we)Tj
T*(managed the distance in some three hours.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.  The grey church)Tj
T*(looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.  I distinguished a)Tj
T*(moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.  It was sweet, warm)Tj
T*(weather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from)Tj
T*(enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer)Tj
T*(August, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its)Tj
T*(solitudes.  In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,)Tj
T*(than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the)Tj
T*(family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue)Tj
T*(wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.  I rode)Tj
T*(into the court.  Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and)Tj
T*(an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mistress Dean?  Nay!' she answered, 'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at)Tj
T*(th' Heights.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master.  Are there any rooms to lodge me in,)Tj

T*(coming?  Yah sud ha' send word.  They's nowt norther dry nor mensful)Tj
T*(abaht t' place: nowt there isn't!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered)Tj
T*(too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had)Tj
T*(almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.)Tj
T*(I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner)Tj
T*(of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.  No)Tj
T*(sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.  She)Tj
T*(seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into)Tj
T*(the grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other)Tj
T*(articles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a)Tj
T*(resting-place against my return.  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my)Tj
T*(proposed excursion.  An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted)Tj
T*(the court.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot)Tj
T*(cinders.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was)Tj
T*(impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my)Tj
T*(exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,)Tj
T*(and the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other)Tj
T*(brightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road)Tj
T*(branching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  Before I arrived in sight of)Tj
T*(it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:)Tj
T*(but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by)Tj
T*(that splendid moon.  I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it)Tj
T*(yielded to my hand.  That is an improvement, I thought.  And I noticed)Tj
T*(another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers)Tj
T*(wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a)Tj
T*(coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which)Tj
T*(the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.  But the house)Tj
T*(of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space)Tj
T*(for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there)Tj
T*(were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.  I could)Tj
T*(both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and)Tj
T*(listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of)Tj
T*(curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Con-_trary_!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.  'That for the)Tj
T*(third time, you dunce!  I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or)Tj
T*(I'll pull your hair!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now,)Tj
T*(kiss me, for minding so well.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed)Tj
T*(and seated at a table, having a book before him.  His handsome features)Tj
T*(glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the)Tj

T*(inattention.  Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets)Tj
T*(blending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend)Tj
T*(his studies; and her face--it was lucky he could not see her face, or he)Tj
T*(would never have been so steady.  I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at)Tj

T*(The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed)Tj

T*(generously returned.  Then they came to the door, and from their)Tj
T*(conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the)Tj
T*(moors.  I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if)Tj
T*(not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed)Tj
T*(my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean)Tj
T*(and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.  There was)Tj
T*(unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old)Tj
T*(friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted)Tj
T*(from within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from)Tj
T*(musical accents.)Tj

T*('I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to)Tj

T*(answer to an unheard speech of Nelly's.  'It's a blazing shame, that I)Tj

T*(all t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld!  Oh!)Tj

T*('No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the)Tj
T*(singer.  'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and)Tj

T*(Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me)Tj
T*(directly, she jumped to her feet, crying--'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!)Tj
T*(How could you think of returning in this way?  All's shut up at)Tj
T*(Thrushcross Grange.  You should have given us notice!')Tj

T*('Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went)Tj
T*(to London, and stay till you returned.  But, step in, pray! Have you)Tj

T*(I looked surprised.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished.  'How long ago?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll)Tj
T*(tell you all about it.  Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.  You sit down too. I)Tj

T*(don't expect them back for some time--the young people?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they)Tj
T*(don't care for me.  At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(She hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking)Tj
T*(whether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her)Tj
T*(time of life?  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar!  He)Tj
T*(fair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(She did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a)Tj
T*(reaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.)Tj
T*(And afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.)Tj
T*(He had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving)Tj
T*(us, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first)Tj
T*(interview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since)Tj
T*(our separation.  Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a)Tj
T*(new mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was)Tj
T*(tired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my)Tj
T*(sitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to)Tj
T*(see her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,)Tj
T*(by degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,)Tj
T*(that had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we)Tj
T*(should get on in tolerable comfort.  The delusion did not last long.)Tj
T*(Catherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and)Tj
T*(restless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and)Tj
T*(it fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew)Tj
T*(on; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her)Tj
T*(frequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling)Tj
T*(with Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.  I did)Tj
T*(not mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the)Tj
T*(kitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and)Tj
T*(though in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly)Tj
T*(joined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him--and)Tj
T*(though he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she)Tj
T*(changed her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking)Tj
T*(at him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder)Tj
T*(how he could endure the life he lived--how he could sit a whole evening)Tj
T*(staring into the fire, and dozing.)Tj

T*('He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a cart-)Tj
T*(horse?  He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What a)Tj

T*('He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued.  'He twitched his shoulder)Tj

T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't)Tj

T*('I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she)Tj

T*(She placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and)Tj

T*(Then she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.  But)Tj
T*(he would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her)Tj
T*(great disappointment.  I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness)Tj
T*(and indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off)Tj
T*(improving himself: she had done it effectually.  But her ingenuity was at)Tj
T*(work to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such)Tj
T*(stationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would)Tj
T*(bring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.  When Hareton was)Tj
T*(there, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book)Tj
T*(lying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule,)Tj
T*(and, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking)Tj
T*(with Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,)Tj
T*(the elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would)Tj
T*(have called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.  On)Tj
T*(fine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine)Tj
T*(yawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the)Tj
T*(court or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and)Tj
T*(said she was tired of living: her life was useless.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost)Tj
T*(banished Earnshaw from his apartment.  Owing to an accident at the)Tj
T*(commencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.)Tj
T*(His gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm,)Tj
T*(and he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.  The)Tj
T*(consequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and)Tj
T*(tranquillity, till he made it up again.  It suited Catherine to have him)Tj
T*(there: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever:)Tj
T*(and she would compel me to find out business below, that she might)Tj

T*(and scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched,)Tj
T*(and his gaze fixed on the ground.  Catherine, by instinct, must have)Tj
T*(divined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this)Tj
T*(dogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped)Tj
T*(and impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.  The little rogue thought I had)Tj
T*(not seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the)Tj
T*(window, quite demurely.  I shook my head reprovingly, and then she)Tj
T*(blushed and whispered--'Well! what should I have done, Ellen?  He)Tj
T*(wouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that)Tj
T*(I like him--that I want to be friends.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Whether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,)Tj

T*(it, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.)Tj

T*(Catherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.)Tj
T*(Hareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.  He did not)Tj
T*(strike it off, either.  I returned to my work.  Catherine leaned her head)Tj
T*(and arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering)Tj
T*(being removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her)Tj
T*(cousin.  He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his)Tj
T*(surly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first,)Tj
T*(to utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured)Tj
T*(petition.)Tj

T*(We always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.  I held the mistress's post)Tj
T*(in making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.  Catherine)Tj
T*(usually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I)Tj

T*(on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.  I)Tj

T*(on other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she)Tj
T*(grew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.)Tj
T*(Afterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton)Tj
T*(uttered a smothered laugh.  Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly)Tj
T*(surveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of)Tj
T*(nervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.)Tj

T*(said, with assumed calmness--'You must learn to avoid putting me in a)Tj

T*(The two new friends established themselves in the house during his)Tj
T*(absence; where I heard Hareton sternly cheek his cousin, on her offering)Tj
T*(a revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father.  He said he)Tj
T*(wouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the)Tj
T*(devil, it didn't signify; he would stand by him; and he'd rather she)Tj
T*(would abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.)Tj
T*(Catherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold)Tj
T*(her tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her)Tj
T*(father?  Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation)Tj
T*(home to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could)Tj
T*(break--chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to)Tj

T*(satisfaction.  His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly)Tj
T*(the clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and)Tj
T*(Catherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.  His)Tj
T*(brightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility)Tj
T*(to their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld)Tj
T*(on the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her)Tj
T*(expedition to the Crags.  While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew)Tj
T*(on, and with it returned the master.  He came upon us quite unexpectedly,)Tj
T*(entering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we)Tj
T*(could raise our heads to glance at him.  Well, I reflected, there was)Tj
T*(never a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning)Tj
T*(shame to scold them.  The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads,)Tj
T*(and revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;)Tj

T*(novelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the)Tj

T*(that makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.  With)Tj
T*(Hareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times,)Tj
T*(_then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and)Tj
T*(his mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.  I suppose this)Tj
T*(resemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident)Tj
T*(agitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I)Tj
T*(should say, altered its character; for it was there yet.  He took the)Tj
T*(book from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it)Tj
T*(without any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion)Tj
T*(lingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he)Tj
T*(bid me sit still.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded awhile)Tj
T*(on the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to my violent)Tj
T*(exertions?  I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and)Tj
T*(train myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything)Tj

T*(precise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it;)Tj
T*(and none could hinder me.  But where is the use?  I don't care for)Tj
T*(striking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand!  That sounds as if I)Tj
T*(had been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of)Tj

T*(enjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.)Tj

T*(things, and entertaining odd fancies.  He might have had a monomania on)Tj
T*(the subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were)Tj
T*(as sound as mine.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I shall not know that till it comes,' he said; 'I'm only half conscious)Tj
T*(of it now.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('You have no feeling of illness, have you?' I asked.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, Nelly, I have not,' he answered.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Then you are not afraid of death?' I pursued.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Afraid?  No!' he replied.  'I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,)Tj
T*(nor a hope of death.  Why should I?  With my hard constitution and)Tj
T*(temperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and)Tj
T*(probably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair)Tj
T*(on my head.  And yet I cannot continue in this condition!  I have to)Tj
T*(remind myself to breathe--almost to remind my heart to beat!  And it is)Tj
T*(like bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the)Tj
T*(slightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I)Tj
T*(notice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal)Tj
T*(idea.  I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are)Tj
T*(yearning to attain it.  They have yearned towards it so long, and so)Tj
T*(unwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and soon--because it)Tj
T*(has devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its)Tj
T*(fulfilment.  My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account)Tj
T*(for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show.  O God!)Tj
T*(It is a long fight; I wish it were over!')Tj

T*(CHAPTER XXXIV)Tj
T*()Tj
T*()Tj
T*(For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at)Tj
T*(meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.  He)Tj
T*(had an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing)Tj
T*(rather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed)Tj
T*(sufficient sustenance for him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and)Tj
T*(out at the front door.  I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I)Tj
T*(found he was still away.  We were in April then: the weather was sweet)Tj
T*(and warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the)Tj
T*(two dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.  After)Tj
T*(breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my)Tj
T*(work under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled)Tj
T*(Hareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and)Tj
T*(arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the)Tj
T*(influence of Joseph's complaints.  I was comfortably revelling in the)Tj
T*(spring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my)Tj
T*(young lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots)Tj
T*(for a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.)Tj
T*(Heathcliff was coming in.  'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a)Tj
T*(perplexed countenance.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What did he say?' asked Hareton.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('He told me to begone as fast as I could,' she answered.  'But he looked)Tj
T*(so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at)Tj
T*(him.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('How?' he inquired.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Why, almost bright and cheerful.  No, _almost_ nothing--_very much_)Tj
T*(excited, and wild, and glad!' she replied.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Night-walking amuses him, then,' I remarked, affecting a careless)Tj
T*(manner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the)Tj
T*(truth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be)Tj
T*(an every-day spectacle.  I framed an excuse to go in.  Heathcliff stood)Tj
T*(at the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a)Tj
T*(strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole)Tj
T*(face.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Will you have some breakfast?' I said.  'You must be hungry, rambling)Tj
T*(about all night!'  I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not)Tj
T*(like to ask directly.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather)Tj
T*(contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of)Tj
T*(his good humour.)Tj

T*(I felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity)Tj
T*(to offer a bit of admonition.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I don't think it right to wander out of doors,' I observed, 'instead of)Tj
T*(being in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.  I daresay)Tj
T*(you'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with)Tj
T*(you now!')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nothing but what I can bear,' he replied; 'and with the greatest)Tj
T*(pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes!' I reflected to myself, 'we shall have a fit of illness.  I cannot)Tj
T*(conceive what he has been doing.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate)Tj
T*(from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,' he remarked, in allusion to my)Tj
T*(morning's speech; 'and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the)Tj
T*(inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.  He laid them on the)Tj
T*(table, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.  We saw)Tj
T*(him walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and)Tj
T*(Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had)Tj
T*(grieved him some way.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Well, is he coming?' cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed;)Tj
T*(only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be)Tj
T*(off to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he)Tj
T*(re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same)Tj
T*(unnatural--it was unnatural--appearance of joy under his black brows; the)Tj
T*(same bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of)Tj
T*(smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,)Tj
T*(but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling, rather than)Tj
T*(trembling.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?  And I)Tj
T*(exclaimed--'Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?  You look)Tj
T*(uncommonly animated.')Tj

T*('You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,' he)Tj
T*(interrupted, with a laugh.  'Yet I'll answer it.  Last night I was on the)Tj
T*(threshold of hell.  To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.  I have my)Tj

T*(He did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on)Tj
T*(his solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though)Tj
T*(unsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.  He was leaning)Tj
T*(against the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was)Tj
T*(turned to the interior gloom.  The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room)Tj
T*(was filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still,)Tj
T*(that not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable,)Tj
T*(but its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large)Tj
T*(stones which it could not cover.  I uttered an ejaculation of discontent)Tj
T*(at seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one)Tj
T*(after another, till I came to his.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Must I close this?' I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not)Tj
T*(stir.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(The light flashed on his features as I spoke.  Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot)Tj
T*(express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!  Those deep)Tj
T*(black eyes!  That smile, and ghastly paleness!  It appeared to me, not)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend)Tj
T*(towards the wall, and it left me in darkness.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Yes, close it,' he replied, in his familiar voice.  'There, that is pure)Tj
T*(awkwardness!  Why did you hold the candle horizontally?  Be quick, and)Tj
T*(bring another.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph--'The)Tj
T*(master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.'  For I)Tj
T*(dared not go in myself again just then.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it)Tj
T*(back immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that)Tj
T*(Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till)Tj
T*(morning.  We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to)Tj
T*(his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its)Tj
T*(window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through;)Tj
T*(and it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he)Tj
T*(had rather we had no suspicion.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Is he a ghoul or a vampire?' I mused.  I had read of such hideous)Tj
T*(incarnate demons.  And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him)Tj
T*(in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost)Tj
T*(through his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to)Tj
T*(that sense of horror.  'But where did he come from, the little dark)Tj
T*(thing, harboured by a good man to his bane?' muttered Superstition, as I)Tj
T*(dozed into unconsciousness.  And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself)Tj
T*(with imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking)Tj
T*(meditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at)Tj
T*(last, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is,)Tj

T*(being exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription)Tj
T*(for his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no)Tj
T*(surname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content)Tj
T*(ourselves with the single word, 'Heathcliff.'  That came true: we were.)Tj
T*(If you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his headstone, only that, and)Tj
T*(the date of his death.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Dawn restored me to common sense.  I rose, and went into the garden, as)Tj
T*(soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his)Tj
T*(window.  There were none.  'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'll)Tj
T*(be all right to-day.'  I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my)Tj
T*(usual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master)Tj
T*(came down, for he lay late.  They preferred taking it out of doors, under)Tj
T*(the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(On my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.  He and Joseph were)Tj
T*(conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions)Tj
T*(concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his)Tj
T*(head continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more)Tj
T*(exaggerated.  When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place)Tj
T*(he generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.  He drew it)Tj
T*(nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite)Tj
T*(wall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with)Tj
T*(glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped)Tj
T*(breathing during half a minute together.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Come now,' I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, 'eat and)Tj
T*(drink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled.  I'd rather have seen him gnash)Tj
T*(his teeth than smile so.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Mr. Heathcliff! master!' I cried, 'don't, for God's sake, stare as if)Tj
T*(you saw an unearthly vision.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,' he replied.  'Turn round, and)Tj
T*(tell me, are we by ourselves?')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Of course,' was my answer; 'of course we are.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Still, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.  With a)Tj
T*(sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast)Tj
T*(things, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Now, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him)Tj
T*(alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards')Tj
T*(distance.  And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both)Tj
T*(pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet)Tj
T*(raptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.  The fancied)Tj
T*(object was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied)Tj
T*(diligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.  I vainly)Tj
T*(reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to)Tj
T*(touch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand)Tj
T*(out to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it,)Tj
T*(and remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from)Tj
T*(its engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking)Tj
T*(why I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and)Tj

T*(The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.  I did not retire to)Tj

T*(midnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room)Tj
T*(beneath.  I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and)Tj
T*(descended.  It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a)Tj
T*(hundred idle misgivings.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor,)Tj

T*(the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or)Tj
T*(suffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and)Tj
T*(earnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.  I had not courage to walk)Tj
T*(straight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his)Tj
T*(reverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and)Tj
T*(began to scrape the cinders.  It drew him forth sooner than I expected.)Tj
T*(He opened the door immediately, and said--'Nelly, come here--is it)Tj
T*(morning?  Come in with your light.')Tj

T*('It is striking four,' I answered.  'You want a candle to take up-stairs:)Tj

T*(fire, and do anything there is to do about the room.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,' I replied,)Tj
T*(getting a chair and the bellows.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his)Tj
T*(heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for)Tj
T*(common breathing between.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('When day breaks I'll send for Green,' he said; 'I wish to make some)Tj
T*(legal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and)Tj
T*(while I can act calmly.  I have not written my will yet; and how to leave)Tj
T*(my property I cannot determine.  I wish I could annihilate it from the)Tj
T*(face of the earth.')Tj

T*('I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed.  'Let your will be a)Tj
T*(while: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet!  I never)Tj
T*(expected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present,)Tj
T*(marvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.  The)Tj
T*(way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan.  Do take)Tj
T*(some food, and some repose.  You need only look at yourself in a glass to)Tj
T*(see how you require both.  Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes blood-)Tj
T*(shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of)Tj
T*(sleep.')Tj

T*(rest within arms' length of the shore!  I must reach it first, and then)Tj
T*(I'll rest.  Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices,)Tj

T*(probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.  You)Tj

T*(me: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions)Tj

T*('They won't do that,' he replied: 'if they did, you must have me removed)Tj

T*(As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired)Tj

T*(wild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.)Tj
T*(I declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner)Tj
T*(frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his)Tj
T*(companion alone.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh:)Tj
T*('something too horrible to live under a decent roof.'  Then turning to)Tj
T*(Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he)Tj

T*(to you I've made myself worse than the devil.  Well, there is _one_ who)Tj
T*(won't shrink from my company!  By God! she's relentless.  Oh, damn it!)Tj
T*(It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear--even mine.')Tj
T*()Tj
T*(He solicited the society of no one more.  At dusk he went into his)Tj

T*(peeped in.  Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his back.  His eyes met)Tj
T*(mine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.  I could)Tj
T*(not think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the)Tj
T*(bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.  The lattice, flapping)Tj
T*(to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood)Tj
T*(trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could)Tj
T*(doubt no more: he was dead and stark!)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I)Tj
T*(tried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful, life-)Tj
T*(like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it.  They would not)Tj
T*(shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and sharp)Tj
T*(white teeth sneered too!  Taken with another fit of cowardice, I cried)Tj
T*(out for Joseph.  Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but resolutely)Tj
T*(refused to meddle with him.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('Th' divil's harried off his soul,' he cried, 'and he may hev' his)Tj
T*(carcass into t' bargin, for aught I care!  Ech! what a wicked 'un he)Tj
T*(looks, girning at death!' and the old sinner grinned in mockery.  I)Tj
T*(thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing)Tj
T*(himself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks)Tj
T*(that the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their)Tj
T*(rights.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to)Tj
T*(former times with a sort of oppressive sadness.  But poor Hareton, the)Tj
T*(most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.  He sat by the)Tj
T*(corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.  He pressed its hand, and)Tj
T*(kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from)Tj
T*(contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs)Tj
T*(naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(Mr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.)Tj
T*(I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days,)Tj
T*(fearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not)Tj
T*(abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not)Tj
T*(the cause.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.)Tj
T*(Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended)Tj
T*(the whole attendance.  The six men departed when they had let it down)Tj
T*(into the grave: we stayed to see it covered.  Hareton, with a streaming)Tj
T*(face, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at)Tj
T*(present it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope)Tj
T*(its tenant sleeps as soundly.  But the country folks, if you ask them,)Tj
T*(would swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to)Tj
T*(having met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this)Tj
T*(house.  Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I.  Yet that old man by the)Tj
T*(kitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber)Tj
T*(window on every rainy night since his death:--and an odd thing happened)Tj
T*(to me about a month ago.  I was going to the Grange one evening--a dark)Tj
T*(evening, threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I)Tj
T*(encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was)Tj
T*(crying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be)Tj
T*(guided.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*('What is the matter, my little man?' I asked.)Tj

T*()Tj
T*(I saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take)Tj

T*(As they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at)Tj
T*(the moon--or, more correctly, at each other by her light--I felt)Tj
T*(irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance)Tj
T*(into the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my)Tj
T*(rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;)Tj
T*(and so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his)Tj
T*(fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me)Tj
T*(for a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.)Tj
T*(When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in)Tj
T*(seven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and)Tj
T*(slates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to)Tj
T*(be gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the)Tj
T*(moor: on middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's)Tj
T*(only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's)Tj
T*(still bare.)Tj
T*()Tj
T*(I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths)Tj
T*(fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind)Tj
T*(breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine)Tj
T*(unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.)Tj
