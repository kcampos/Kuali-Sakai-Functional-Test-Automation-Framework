A Basic Usage Example for OAE:

require "watir-webdriver"
require "page-object"
require "config"        # These lines assume you've added
require "utilities"     # the various relevant file paths
require "app_functions" # to Ruby's load path.
require "page_elements" #

# Log in to Sakai OAE with "username" and "password"...
dashboard = @sakai.login("username", "password") # See the SakaiOAE class in app_functions.rb

# Go to the course library page for "Econ 101"...
course_library = dashboard.open_course "Econ 101"   # See the page_elements.rb file. Specifically, see
                                                    # GlobalMethods, MyDashboard, and Library.
